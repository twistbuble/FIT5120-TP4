2,Veselka's Famous Borscht,"['3 pounds (10 to 12) small beets, scrubbed thoroughly but not peeled', '9 tablespoons white vinegar', 'One 2-pound boneless pork butt, halved', '8 cups beef, chicken, or vegetable stock', '1 bay leaf', '1 teaspoon whole allspice berries', '1 tablespoon whole black peppercorns', '3 large carrots, peeled and sliced', '3 large celery stalks, sliced', '1 small head of green cabbage (about ¾ to 1 pound), shredded (about 4 cups)', '2 medium Idaho potatoes, peeled and cut into ½-inch dice', 'One 15-ounce can lima beans, drained and rinsed', 'Salt']","To make the “beet water,” roughly chop 2 pounds of the beets (select the smaller ones), preferably in a food processor fitted with the metal blade. Place the chopped beets in a large stockpot. Add 10 cups of water and 1 tablespoon vinegar.
Place the stockpot over high heat and bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 2 hours. (If it seems like the liquid is evaporating too quickly, you may need to cover the pot partially with an offset lid.) The beets should be extremely soft and the liquid bright red.
Strain the liquid, pressing the cooked beets against the side of the strainer to extract as much liquid as possible. Discard the pulp or reserve. Set aside the beet water. You should have just about 4 cups.
Meanwhile, place the remaining 1 pound of whole beets in a separate large stockpot. Add water to cover and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, and simmer until the beets are tender-firm, about 40 minutes. When the beets are cooked, add 1 tablespoon white vinegar and set them aside to cool.
When the whole cooked beets are cool enough to handle, peel them; the skins should slip off easily. Grate the peeled beets on the largest holes of a box grater or in a food processor fitted with the grating blade.
To make the broth, place the pork butt in a large stockpot and add the beef stock. If necessary, add a little more stock or water to cover. Add the bay leaf, allspice berries, and peppercorns. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to low, and simmer until the meat is tender and beginning to fall apart, about 2 hours. Set the pork aside to cool. When the pork is cool enough to handle, remove it from the pot and cut the meat into ½-inch cubes. Strain the broth and discard the bay leaf, allspice berries, and peppercorns. Reserve the cubed meat and 4 cups of the broth.
To cook the vegetables, place the carrots and celery in a large stockpot and pour the reserved meat broth over them. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer until the carrots and celery are just tender, about 8 minutes. Add the cabbage and potatoes and continue to cook until the potatoes and carrots are easily pierced with a pairing knife but keep their shape, 15 to 20 additional minutes. Add the lima beans and cook for 5 additional minutes, just to meld the flavors. Gradually add the remaining 7 tablespoons white vinegar, tasting between additions and stopping when the flavor is to your liking. Remove the soup from the heat and set aside.
To compose the soup, in a large soup pot combine the “beet water” and meat broth with the vegetables. Add the cubed pork and the grated beets. Stir to combine and bring to a simmer over low heat. Season to taste with salt and serve immediately.",veselkas-famous-borscht,0,

Season with salt.
Do Ahead: Yogurt can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill.
Rinse lentils, then soak in 2 cups water at room temperature at least 1 hour and up to 12 hours. (Soaking the lentils makes them tender and a lot easier to blend.)
Meanwhile, trim ends of zucchini and cut crosswise into 3 pieces about 2"" long. Cut each piece lengthwise into ¼""-thick planks. Stack a few planks and slice lengthwise into ¼""-thick matchsticks (about the size of a skinny french fry). Transfer zucchini to a colander set in a medium bowl. Add onion and 1 tsp. salt and toss to combine. Let sit until vegetables look wilted and softened and about 1 Tbsp. liquid has released into bowl, 30 minutes to 2 hours. Gently pat dry with paper towels to remove any excess moisture.
Drain lentils and transfer to a food processor. Add chile powder, turmeric, and ¾ tsp. salt. Pulse, scraping down sides, until a purée forms. Transfer to a medium bowl and add zucchini and onion, parsley, and lemon zest. Toss with a rubber spatula to combine.
Line a rimmed baking sheet with paper towels; set a wire rack inside. Heat ghee in a medium cast-iron skillet over medium-high until a pinch of batter added to the pan sizzles and sputters. Using a large spoon, scoop out about ¼ cup batter, then use a second large spoon dipped in the hot ghee to carefully scrape into pan; flatten with ghee-coated spoon. Repeat to make 3 more fritters. Fry until deep golden brown underneath, about 3 minutes. Turn over with a wide slotted spatula and fry until deep golden brown on the second side, about 3 minutes. Transfer fritters to prepared rack to drain; season immediately with salt. Repeat with remaining batter (you end up with 8–10 fritters total).

11,Crispy Tofu Balls,"['1 (19-ounce) package firm tofu', '⅓ cup finely chopped scallions', '5 ⅓ teaspoons mushroom bouillon', '4 tablespoons fresh corn, off the cob', '2 pinches ground white pepper', 'Spicy aioli, for garnish and dip', '1 cup all-purpose flour', '1 ¼ cups water', '2 ¼ teaspoons mushroom bouillon', '1 (12-ounce) package green glutinous rice flakes (aka com dep xanh)', '½ cup cornstarch']","Pressing the tofu is the most important step, so I’m going to give y’all (I grew up in Texas, so I have the liberty to use “y’all” liberally) three pressing options. The first step before you press is the same: Drain the liquid from the box of tofu. Then press.
Method 1: (Easiest) Use a tofu-pressing machine! I spotted one of these in Torrance, California, at a little Japanese grocery store. You place a block of tofu in between two plates and turn a small crank to compress it. Though it will press only one block at a time—the boxes of tofu we use come four to a box—you can set it and forget it (but do it three more times if you plan on using all the tofu).
Method 2: (Most common) Use two similar-size plates or relatively flat surfaces. Lay out the blocks of tofu flat in a single layer on one of the plates, and then put the second plate on top of the tofu. Press the tofu by placing at least 10 pounds of weight on top of the second plate.
Method 3: (Most “professional”) We still prepare the tofu this way at our restaurant, which is, without question, the most efficient way to prepare larger servings. Lay baking racks/grates inside baking sheets, then cover racks with clean (lint-free) towels or, as we did successfully for four years, with neatly folded aprons laid in a single layer as level and as flat as possible across the racks. Yup, towels or aprons, plural. Because tofu holds so much moisture, the liquid constantly spills over, and we’ve found very few people who just live to clean. To absorb the moisture, and to create much less of a mess, we started using layers of cloth.
Lay out the tofu on the covered racks in a single layer, organized as tightly as possible. Make sure the tofu doesn’t hang over the sides of the sheets or it won’t be pressed evenly. Next, lay another towel/apron on top of the layer of tofu, again, flat and level. Then lay another equal-size baking sheet + covered rack + tofu on top of that. Repeat the same steps as needed. The top layer should be a baking sheet on which you place 30 to 40 pounds of “stuff” to press down on all the layers. No matter how many layers you stack, the tofu should flatten out only slightly, not be completely crushed.
Processing the tofu is far simpler than pressing it, though like pressing, there are three different ways to do it. Start with a bowl or a large (22-quart) plastic container made by and known as a Cambro (if you have one of those lying around), and do one of the following:
Method 1: Use a food mill, which is what we use. This is by far the easiest way to process tofu and get the most consistent texture (and it’s a great method for mashing anything).
Method 2: Use a potato masher. Just mash away, but you’ll still need to use the third option to smash out any little lumps that the masher doesn’t, um, well, mash.
Method 3: Mash everything with your hands. (This is the most common way.)
Process the tofu until it is a consistent, almost pasty texture. If you go with No. 2 or No. 3, make sure to smash out all lumps from the tofu or else the seasoning won’t evenly distribute throughout the mix and, later, the balls.
Add chopped scallions, mushroom bouillon, corn, and ground white pepper to the (hopefully) evenly processed tofu. Stick your hands in (maybe with gloves) and mix all the ingredients. Taste some of the mix from different areas of the bowl/container to make sure it’s evenly seasoned. It should taste savory, with little bits of scallion and corn in every bite.
Now it’s ball-rolling time! Scoop out a tablespoon of the tofu mixture, hand-pack it tightly into the spoon, then level out the spoon with your finger. Assertively shake or scoop out the mix into your hand while mostly keeping it in one piece. Firmly clench the tofu by making a fist, packing it very tightly so it doesn’t fall apart.
Continue by shaping into a ball, either with one hand or by lightly tossing the ball back and forth between both hands like you’re playing catch with yourself. Lightly roll the tofu between your hands, moving your hands in an alternating clockwise motion, like you would forming a meatball, only more gently to smooth out any cracks. Tofu is very docile; the more you do it, the better you’ll get the feel of it (like most things in life). Place tofu balls on a plate or (ideally) a baking sheet rack.
Optional: Refrigerate the balls overnight, uncovered. This will firm them up.
Add flour, water, and mushroom bouillon to a bowl. Mix together. It should not be lumpy; the consistency should be not too thin and consistently thick enough to adhere, but not so thick it doesn’t drip off your finger.
Empty the green rice flakes into a separate bowl or catering pan, then mix in half of the dry cornstarch with flakes. Next, drop balls into flour paste. Shake off excess paste (we highly recommend using a kitchen “spider” strainer to do this), then roll balls around in the flakes until they’re fully coated. Gently clench the balls to pack one last bit of flakes onto the balls. If flakes start to drop off the balls, mix in more of the remaining cornstarch to dry flakes, then try again.
Set balls on a rack.
Optional: If you plan on making more and hate waste like we do, clean and dry your hands, then sift through all the flakes. Throw out any moist clumps of flakes. Store dry flakes in a closed container, then refrigerate until your next tofu ball–rolling party!
Optional: Refrigerate the fully flaked balls uncovered (and preferably elevated on a rack) overnight. This will give the flakes more time to adhere and dry out, which is important in giving the balls more puff, crunch, and an overall prettier look after frying.
Add at least 2 inches of oil to a pot, bring to 177°C over high heat, then fry the balls for about 3 to 4 minutes, or until the flakes puff up bright green and any exposed tofu turns a slight golden color. If the balls start turning brown, the oil’s too hot or you’re frying them for too long. If the balls look oily or wet after frying, either the temperature is too low or you’re frying too many balls at once, which lowers the temperature of the oil too quickly.
Remove from oil, shake off excess, drip dry on a rack. Plate and top with spicy aioli and more aioli on the side to dip.",crispy-tofu-balls,0,

You’ll have to pile the spinach up on top of the rice, but it will cook down and form a lovely green topping: Instead of tomatoes and eggs, use 1 pound fresh spinach, rinsed, trimmed of thick stems, and chopped. When you put it in the bowl with the olive oil, add 1 tablespoon minced lemon zest.
You could also make this with limas or edamame: Instead of the tomatoes and eggs, use 1 cup shelled and peeled fava beans (frozen are fine).",paella-with-tomatoes-and-eggs,0,

Trim bread to fit in 2 even layers in a 13x9"" baking dish, with the whole slices on the bottom and the slices with holes on the top, forming 6 sandwiches. Remove from dish.
Melt butter in a medium pot over medium heat. Add flour and cook, whisking constantly, until butter foams then subsides (make sure it doesn't brown), and mixture is light gold and thickened, about 3 minutes. Slowly add milk, whisking constantly to prevent lumps from forming. Increase heat to medium-high and cook, whisking, until mixture thickens and coats the back of a spoon, 4–6 minutes. Reduce heat to very low. Whisk in nutmeg, 3/4 tsp. salt, and 1/4 tsp. pepper into the Béchamel sauce. Whisk in 1 cup Gruyère a handful at a time, making sure cheese is melted before adding more. (Béchamel with cheese added is technically called a Mornay sauce.) You should have about 3 1/2 cups of sauce.
Spread one-third of the Béchamel in the dish. Arrange 6 whole slices of bread in a single layer in dish. Spread Dijon evenly on bread. Top each with 2 slices of ham, folding to fit on bread if necessary.
Spread another third of the Béchamel over ham. Sprinkle evenly with 1 cup Gruyère. Place 6 bread slices with holes on top to form 6 sandwiches. Spread remaining Béchamel over sandwiches; sprinkle with 1 cup Gruyère (avoid holes to save room for eggs).

Place the bean sprouts, limes, and peanuts each in their own small bowl and arrange near the stove. Place the fish sauce, granulated sugar, and crushed red pepper each in their own small bowl and arrange on the dining table.
Bring a 3-quart saucepan of water to a full, rolling boil. Remove it from the heat and immediately add the rice noodles, making sure they are fully submerged in the water. Let the noodles soak for exactly 3 minutes (use a timer), occasionally lifting them up and pulling them apart as necessary with tongs or a long fork to keep the noodles separate and help them soften evenly. Drain the noodles in a large colander and rinse them under cold running water. (If the noodles become sticky and clumped together while standing, rinse them briefly under cold water just before cooking, so that they return to their slippery, firm, toss-able state.)
In a small bowl, combine the garlic and shallot. Place the shrimp, beaten eggs, bean sprouts, scallion greens, and peanuts each in their own bowl and arrange near the stove. Have ready 1 clean medium bowl for the cooked shrimp and eggs, and arrange a large plate or platter for serving near the stove.
Heat a 12-inch heavy, deep skillet or sauté pan or a large wok over high heat until hot but not smoking. (If at any point during cooking the oil starts smoking, lower the heat.) Add 1 tablespoon of the vegetable oil and swirl to coat the pan. When the oil is hot, scatter in the shrimp. Cook undisturbed until the shrimp begin to change color and firm up, about 30 seconds. Toss well then continue to cook, stirring frequently, until the shrimp are pink, firm, and just cooked through, about 30 seconds longer. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the shrimp to the clean bowl.
Add the eggs and swirl the pan to spread them into a thin layer. Cook the eggs, lifting the sides and tilting the pan to allow the uncooked eggs to pour underneath as you would do with an omelet, until the eggs are mostly set, about 1 minute. Remove the pan from the heat and use the slotted spoon to quickly cut the eggs into bite-size pieces, then add them to the bowl of shrimp.
Place the pan over high heat and add the remaining 2 tablespoons of the vegetable oil, swirling the pan to coat it evenly (if at any point during cooking the oil starts smoking, lower the heat). Add the garlic and shallot and stir-fry until fragrant, about 5 seconds. Scatter in the softened rice noodles, and, using tongs, evenly spread the noodles out across the pan, like a net. Let them cook undisturbed for 15 seconds then scoop them in toward the center. Toss the noodles gently then spread them out again. Pour about 1/3 of the seasoning sauce around the edges of the pan, and continue stir-frying the noodles in the same manner, spreading them out and letting them cook undisturbed occasionally, until most of the sauce is absorbed, about 30 seconds more.
Add another third of the sauce and continue to stir-fry in the same manner until most of the sauce is absorbed and the noodles are just tender but not mushy, about 30 seconds. Test a noodle or two: If they are too firm, add about 2 tablespoons of water around the edge of the pan, and continue stir-frying until they are just tender and evenly coated with the sauce.
Return the shrimp and eggs to the pan, along with any juices collected in the bottom of the bowl, and toss to incorporate them into the noodles. Add the remaining third of the seasoning sauce, along with the bean sprouts, scallion greens, and chopped peanuts, and cook, tossing, until they are mixed in and barely heated, about 30 seconds.
Quickly transfer the noodles to the platter, mounding them at one end. Mound the reserved bean sprouts next to the noodles, and arrange the reserved lime wedges next to the bean sprouts. Sprinkle the peanuts on the noodles in a stripe next to the bean sprouts.

Place brisket in large nonreactive roaster with snug-fitting lid (I used one measuring 15 1/2 inches long, 12 inches wide, and 4 inches deep). Pour Coca-Cola evenly over brisket, cover, and refrigerate 24 hours, turning brisket once or twice in Coca-Cola marinade.
2. When ready to proceed, preheat oven to 163°C. Lift brisket from roaster and pat dry. Line large fine sieve with coffee filter and set over medium-size bowl. Pour in Coca-Cola marinade and let drip through.
3. Rub brisket well on both sides with salt and pepper. Heat oil in very large (15-inch) heavy skillet about 1 minute over high heat until ripples appear on pan bottom. Add brisket and brown 3 to 4 minutes on each side. Return brisket to roaster, now rinsed and dried.
4. For Gravy: Combine 2 cups filtered Coca-Cola marinade, soup mix, tomato sauce, and ketchup and pour over brisket. Scatter sliced onions on top and drop in bay leaves. Note: If you use fresh bay leaves, crinkle them a bit as you drop them into the roaster to release their flavor.
5. Cover roaster, slide into lower third of oven, and braise brisket 4 hours. Check roaster at half time and if liquid seems skimpy—not likely—add a little more filtered Coca-Cola marinade, or beef broth, or water.
6. Remove roaster from oven and set on trivet on counter. Remove lid and cool brisket at least 30 minutes to allow juices to settle and meat to firm up. Note: Some cooks bring the brisket to room temperature before serving. Discard bay leaves and remaining Coca-Cola marinade.
7. To serve, lift brisket to cutting board and slice about 1/4 inch thick—across the grain and slightly on the bias. Overlap brisket slices on large platter and smother with pan gravy and onions. The best accompaniment? For me nothing beats a tart and creamy coleslaw.",atlanta-brisket-51139200,0,

Combine the first nine ingredients in a food processor. Pulse three times to aerate. Add the cold butter and pulse ten times, until the butter is the size of small peas. Add 6 tablespoons of ice water and pulse. The dough does not need to form a ball. Simply press the dough and see if it comes together. If it seems crumbly, add another tablespoon of ice water.
2. Transfer the dough onto a work surface and knead it a couple of times. Quickly form it into a 6-inch square. Do not handle the dough too much, and don't worry if it isn't a perfect square. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap, flatten it, and refrigerate it for 30 minutes.
3. Preheat the oven to 191°C (190°C). Remove the dough from the refrigerator. It is best to work on a cold surface, such as marble. Dust your surface and your rolling pin with a little bit of superfine brown rice flour. Roll the dough to a rectangle that is approximately 7 by 10 inches and 1/4 inch thick. Again, it doesn't have to be perfect. Work quickly so the dough doesn't become too soft. If it cracks, pinch it back together.

Combine all the ingredients in a blender and mix until a thin batter forms. Chill the batter for at least 1 hour before using. It can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours.
2. Heat an 8-inch nonstick sauté pan over medium heat. Brush the bottom and sides of the pan with some of the melted butter reserved for this purpose.
3. Stir the chilled batter. Add about 2 tablespoons of batter to the pan while swirling it. This ensures a thin layer of the batter all over the pan. You want thin crêpes. Let the crêpe cook for about 30 seconds or until it gets lightly golden. Tuck in the sides with a rubber spatula. Using a spatula or even your hands (careful!), quickly flip the crêpe over and finish cooking. The first crêpe is usually a test one, so don't worry if it sticks. Transfer it to a plate and repeat with the rest of the batter. Stack all the crêpes. They should not stick together.

Pierce the softest eye of the coconut with a metal skewer or small screwdriver and drain any liquid into a small bowl to sample—you should have about 1/2 cup liquid. (If the liquid tastes sweet, the coconut is fresh; if it tastes oily, the coconut is rancid and should be discarded.)
Bake the coconut for 15 minutes then transfer to a folded towel on a work surface. Using the back of a knife or a cleaver, crack the shell open. Break the shell into large pieces and use a strong knife to carefully remove the flesh from the shell.

Rinse and drain the millet. Put it in a heavy pot (enameled cast-iron, if you have one). Add the milk, 2 cups water, and a big pinch of salt. Stir. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce to a gentle simmer, cover, and cook, stirring occasionally so the bottom doesn't burn, until tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Stir in the nutmeg and thyme and cook another 3 minutes. The consistency should be like that of a soft polenta with some millet nuggets in it.

Add the butter and thyme and pulse until pea-size chunks form. Keep pulsing while adding the vinegar and then the cold water, 1 tablespoon at a time, stopping when the dough just barely holds together. Form the dough into a disk, wrap it in plastic wrap, and chill in the fridge for at least 30 minutes or up to overnight.
Preheat the oven to 204°C.
On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough into a 13-inch circle. It should be about 1/4 inch thick. Roll the dough around the rolling pin and lift it into an 11-inch fluted tart pan with a removable bottom. Press the dough into the edges and up the sides, making sure to patch up any holes. Gently roll your rolling pin across the top of the tart pan to remove the extra dough and create a clean edge. Prick the bottom of the dough with a fork, lay a piece of parchment paper on top, and fill the tart shell with pie weights (I use rocks from the yard-classy, I know). Bake for 15 minutes. Remove the parchment and weights and bake until the top looks almost dry, another 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool.
While the crust is cooling, prepare the filling. On a rimmed baking sheet, toss the squash with 1/2 tablespoon of the olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and the nutmeg. Spread in an even layer and bake until the squash begins to brown around the edges, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool.
In a large sauté pan over medium heat, warm 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and the garlic. When the garlic starts to sizzle a bit and becomes fragrant, add the Swiss chard, red pepper flakes, and a pinch of salt. Sauté until the chard is wilted, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a large mixing bowl and set aside.
Peel and halve the onion and thinly slice. In the same pan you used for the chard, heat the remaining 1/2 tablespoon olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and a pinch of salt and stir every so often until caramelized, about 20 minutes. When the onions are a nice light brown color, add the balsamic vinegar, stir, and turn off the heat. The onions will absorb the vinegar as they cool a bit.
Squeeze out any excess water from the Swiss chard and return to the bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk the eggs until blended well, then add to the chard. To the bowl with the chard, add three-fourths of the squash, half of the cheese, the onion, and a few grinds of black pepper. Gently mix everything together and pour into the tart pan.

Make the stock: to ensure the pot is large enough to blanch the bones without boiling over, put the bones in the pot and add water to cover by 1 inch. Then remove the bones and set aside.
2. Bring the water to a boil. When it is at a rolling boil, add the oxtails, beef shank, and pork bones. Return the water to a boil and boil for 3 minutes. Drain the bones into a colander and rinse under cold running water. Rinse the pot and return the rinsed oxtails, neck bones, and shanks to the pot. Add the marrowbones and brisket.
3. Cut off the pale, fleshy part (the bottom 4 inches) of each lemongrass stalk and discard the leafy tops. Crush the lemongrass with the side of a cleaver or the bottom of a heavy pan and add it to the pot. Add 8 quarts fresh water and bring to a boil over high heat. Lower the heat so the liquid is at a simmer and skim off any scum that rises to the surface.
4. After 45 minutes, ready an ice-water bath, then check the brisket for doneness by using the chopstick test: transfer the brisket to a plate and poke it with a chopstick; the juices should run clear. If they do not, return the brisket to the pot and continue cooking, checking again in 10 minutes. When the brisket is done, remove it from the pot (reserving the cooking liquid) and immediately submerge it in the ice-water bath, which will stop the cooking and give the meat a firmer texture. When the brisket is completely cool, remove from the water, pat dry, and refrigerate.
5. Continue to simmer the stock for another 2 hours, skimming as needed to remove any scum that forms on the surface. Remove from the heat and remove and discard the large solids. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a large saucepan. Skim most of the fat from the surface of the stock (leave some, as it gives the stock a better flavor and mouthfeel). Return the stock to a simmer over medium heat.
6. In a spice grinder or mortar and pestle, grind the red pepper flakes and annatto seeds into a coarse powder. In a frying pan, heat the oil over medium heat.

Place in a bowl, add water to cover generously, and let soak for at least 2 hours or up to overnight.
Drain the beans, place in a pot, and add water to cover by about 2 inches. Bring the beans to a boil over high heat, adjust the heat to a slow simmer, and cook, uncovered, for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, or until tender. Season with 1 teaspoon salt and remove from the heat. Let cool completely, transfer the beans and their liquid to a storage container, and refrigerate overnight. Drain the beans, reserving their liquid. You should have 1 to 2 cups liquid, and you will need 2 cups for this recipe. If you have less than 2 cups, add water to the cooking liquid to bring it to 2 cups.
In a large, heavy-bottomed pot, heat 1/3 cup of the olive oil over medium heat. Stir in 3 of the garlic cloves, the strips of lemon zest, 1 bay leaf, and 2 teaspoons kosher salt and cook, stirring occasionally, for 3 minutes, or until the garlic begins to soften. Add the octopus, stir to coat it with the oil, and then weight it down with a plate or lid to ensure it does not begin to float once it starts releasing its water. Cover the pot and adjust the heat to a gentle simmer. The octopus should start slowly releasing its water, creating its own braising liquid.
Cook for about 30 minutes and check to see how much braising liquid is in the pot. If it is about 1 cup or less (unlikely if you are using an uncooked whole octopus), add 1 cup of water. Check the tenderness and continue to cook for 30 to 50 minutes longer, or until almost completely tender. The octopus will dramatically decrease in volume. Remove the pot from the heat and allow the octopus to cool in the braising liquid for 1 hour.
Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Add the escarole and cook for about 3 minutes, or until tender. Drain well and when cool enough to handle, chop the leaves coarsely and set aside.
Place a colander over a large bowl. Once the octopus has cooled for 1 hour, transfer it to the colander. Strain the braising liquid through a fine-mesh strainer into a measuring pitcher. Add any extra liquid that has drained from the octopus into the bowl to the braising liquid. You will need 1 cup for the zuppa. Give the pot used to cook the octopus a quick wash and return it to the stove.
Transfer the octopus to a large cutting board. Starting at the thickest point of the tentacle, slice into 1/4-inch-thick-pieces, increasing the thickness of the pieces as the tentacle becomes narrower. Halve the head, then cut it into 1/4-inch strips. Set aside.
To prepare the zuppa, heat the remaining 1/3 cup olive oil in the cleaned pot over medium heat. Add the remaining 3 garlic cloves, the celery, the chiles, and the remaining bay leaf and stir well. Stir in the beans and the reserved cooking liquid. Stir in the octopus and the reserved braising liquid. Heat until hot and then taste for seasoning, adding more salt if needed.
