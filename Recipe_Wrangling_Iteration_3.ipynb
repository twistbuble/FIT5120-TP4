Once the butter begins to foam, add the garlic and use a wooden spoon to stir the mixture constantly until the butter begins to brown and have a slight nutty aroma, about 5 minutes. Add the salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes.

If the pasta feels a bit dry, add a touch of the reserved cooking liquid. Toss to combine and set aside.\\nSet the same skillet (without cleaning it) over medium-high heat. Add the chard stems and cook for 5 minutes. Add the chard leaves and continue to cook, tossing the mixture every so often, until the greens begin to wilt and turn bright green, 3 to 5 minutes longer. Add a touch more butter or oil to the pan if it dries out too much.\\nAdd the Swiss chard and hazelnuts to the pasta and toss it all together. Add the Parmesan shavings and the balsamic vinegar (if you’re using it); toss. Taste for seasonings and add more salt and pepper if needed.\\nServe warm or at room temperature.\\nLocalize it: You can use kale instead of chard, and any nut will work in place of the hazelnuts.

Cover and refrigerate overnight.\\nThe next day, set a large sauté pan over medium heat. Once it’s hot, add the pork, working in batches so as not to overcrowd the pan and leaving any liquid in the bowl. Cook, stirring occasionally and flipping the meat, until lightly caramelized and golden brown on both sides, about 10 minutes. (If you overcrowd the pan, the meat will steam instead of sear.) Transfer to a platter.\\nWhen the meat is cooked, open the buns, butter the interiors, and toast them until they are a light golden brown.\\nTo serve, spread both cut sides of each bun with a healthy smear of mayo and pile the spicy pork generously on the bottoms of the buns. Top with the sliced cucumbers. Serve immediately.\\nThe pork belly must be marinated overnight. You can also grill the pork on an outdoor grill over a high flame. The sugars in the marinade will char and caramelize, giving you a more interesting texture and flavor, but be careful not to burn the pork.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Heat 1 tablespoon oil and 1 tablespoon butter in a large frying pan over a medium heat. Add the sausages and fry for 10 to 15 minutes, until golden and cooked through. Add the bacon and fry for 3 to 4 minutes on each side, until crisp and golden, dabbing off any milky liquid with paper towels. Add the black and/or white pudding slices to the pan and fry for 2 to 3 minutes on each side, until beginning to crisp; the white pudding (if using) should turn golden. Remove the sausages, bacon, and pudding slices from the pan and drain on paper towels.\\nPlace in an ovenproof dish in a low oven to keep warm.\\nMeanwhile, add a dash of oil and pat (knob) of butter to another frying pan over medium heat. Add the button mushrooms and sauté for 3 to 4 minutes, until softened and turning golden. Season with salt and pepper, then remove from the pan and keep warm (adding to the dish with the sausages and bacon). If you are cooking a large flat mushroom, then add the oil and butter to the pan and fry the mushroom for 8 to 10 minutes, turning halfway through, until softened and browned.\\nSeason the cut side of the tomato halves with salt and pepper and drizzle over 1 tablespoon of oil. Gently fry them, cut side down first, for 2 to 3 minutes, then turn over and fry for another 2 to 3 minutes, until just softened.\\nAlternatively, cook the large flat mushroom and/or the tomatoes in the oven. Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C/Gas mark 6). Drizzle 2 teaspoons of olive oil over or add a pat (knob) of butter to the mushroom and season with salt and pepper before roasting for 12 to 15 minutes, until softened. If you are using the oven, begin roasting the mushroom and tomatoes a few minutes before frying the sausages and bacon. Once cooked, decrease the oven temperature to low for keeping everything warm as it is cooked.\\nTo fry an egg, melt a pat (knob) of butter in a small, clean frying pan over low heat. Carefully crack the egg into the pan and allow to fry gently. For an over-easy egg, fry for 1 to 2 minutes, until it begins to set, then flip over and fry for another 1 to 2 minutes. If you prefer your egg sunny side up, then fry gently for 4 to 5 minutes, until the yolk has filmed over. Remove from the pan and serve immediately with the other cooked ingredients.\\nFor scrambled eggs, crack the eggs into a bowl, add the milk, season with salt and pepper, and beat together. Add 1 tablespoon of the butter to a small saucepan over low heat. Immediately pour in the eggs and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring continuously (I find a wooden spatula best for this), until the butter has melted and the eggs are softly scrambled. Remove from the heat immediately so that the eggs don't become overcooked. Serve with the other cooked ingredients.\\nWhile the egg is cooking, put the slices of bread in a toaster or toast under a preheated broiler (grill) for a few minutes (and on both sides, if using the broiler/grill) until golden. Butter the toast and cut the slices in half.\\nTo serve, arrange everything on a warm serving plate, with the hot buttered toast on the side and with some tomato ketchup or relish.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Preheat oven to 225°F. Place pork shoulder, fat side down, on a cutting board with a short end facing you. Holding a long, sharp knife about 1\" above cutting board, make a shallow cut along the entire length of a long side of roast. Continue cutting deeper into the roast, lifting and unfurling meat with your free hand, until it lies flat (be careful not to cut all the way through). Season generously on both sides with salt.\\nMix eggs, chopped garlic, panko, parsley, rosemary, black pepper, red pepper flakes, and 3 oz. Parmesan in a medium bowl. Keeping fattier side of pork shoulder facing downward, smear filling all over top side. Roll up roast and tie closed in 3–4 places with kitchen twine.\\nHeat oil in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium-high. Sear pork roast until browned all over, 10–12 minutes total. Arrange tomatoes and their juices and sliced garlic all around roast and bring to a simmer. Make sure roast is turned fat side up, cover pot, and transfer to oven. Roast until a skewer easily passes through meat (a thermometer inserted into the center should register 200–205°F), 4–5 hours. Keep covered and let rest in pot 30 minutes.\\nTransfer pork roast to a cutting board and remove kitchen twine. Gently mash sauce in pot with a spoon or a potato masher (simmer it gently to thicken, if desired). Taste ragù and season with salt if needed. Slice pork 1\" thick.\\nMeanwhile, cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until al dente; drain.\\nSpoon pasta into a serving dish and top with some ragù; toss to coat. Sprinkle with finely grated Parmesan. Transfer pork to a platter; spoon remaining ragù over.\\nPork can be stuffed and rolled 2 days before roasting; cover and chill. Pork can be roasted 3 days ahead; let cool, then cover and chill. Reheat gently in sauce before serving.</td>\n",

Add enough room-temperature water to cover the brisket by 2 inches. Cover with the lid and cook on the low setting for 8 to 10 hours, until the brisket is really tender—a paring knife should plunge into the meat with little resistance.

Place it on top of the cabbage on the platter, let it rest for 5 minutes, and then slice it into 1/2-inch-thick slabs, against the grain. It will be very tender, and it may fall apart. That’s okay.

Add the cream cheese and process just until the dough comes together in a ball around the blade; be careful not to overprocess or the pastry will be tough. Tip the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and knead for a few seconds, just to bring it together.\\nDivide the pastry in two, cover each half loosely in plastic wrap, then press to flatten into disks.

Remove from the oven, set aside to cool, then chop finely and place in a small bowl with the brown sugar and cinnamon. Mix together and set aside.\\nIn a separate bowl, combine the quince paste and lemon juice to form a smooth paste. (If your quince paste is very firm, warm it gently over low heat to soften [or heat for 10 seconds in a microwave], until the texture is thick like jam but spreadable, then set aside to cool before using).\\nTake one of the pieces of dough from the fridge and roll out on a lightly floured work surface to form a 9 1/2-inch/24-cm circle, about 1/8 inch/3 mm thick. Use a small spatula or the back of a spoon to spread half of the quince paste evenly over the surface and then sprinkle with half of the sugar-nut mixture. Using a sharp knife or a pizza wheel, if you have one, cut the dough as though you are slicing a cake into twelve equal triangles. The best way to get even-sized triangles is to cut it first into quarters, then each quarter into thirds. One at a time, roll each wedge quite tightly, starting from the wide outside edge and working toward the point of the triangle, so that the filling is enclosed. Place them on the lined baking sheets, seam side down, spaced about 1 inch/3 cm apart. Repeat the rolling process with the remaining disk of dough and filling, then chill the rugelachs in the fridge for 30 minutes before baking.\\nIncrease the oven temperature to 400°F/200°C.\\nWhen ready to bake, lightly brush the tops of the rugelachs with the beaten egg and sprinkle with the demerara sugar. Bake for 20–25 minutes, rotating the sheets halfway through, until golden brown all over. Don’t worry if some of the filling oozes out; this will add a lovely toffee taste to the edges of the cookies. Remove from the oven and allow to rest on the sheets for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.\\nThe pastry can be made a day ahead and kept in the fridge, or frozen for up to 3 months (remember to thaw it overnight in the fridge before using). The rolled rugelach can also be frozen (before glazing) for up to 3 months. When you are ready to bake them, brush with the glaze and bake from frozen, adding an extra minute or two to the cooking time.\\nThese will keep for up to 4 days in an open container, separated by pieces of parchment paper, and the whole thing wrapped loosely in aluminum foil. Don’t keep in an airtight container; the sugar will weep if you do and turn the rugelach soft and sticky.</td>\n",

To retain their deep cocoa color, roll the dough in sifted cocoa powder. Serve with generous smears of peanut butter and a tall glass of milk.\\nCinnamon Sugar: We rarely had sugar-coated grahams in our pantry when I was a kid, but they were always at my best friend’s house, and seemed all the more special for their rarity. For the dough, increase the cinnamon to ½ teaspoon. Before docking, dust each sheet of dough with a half batch of Cinnamon Sugar (page 44), or any Sugar Sprinkle (page 46). Otherwise, dock and bake as directed. After the crackers cool, gently tap each against the baking sheet to knock off any excess sugar.\\nCoconut (vegan): Replace the butter with 5 1/2 ounces (3/4 cup) virgin coconut oil (solid but creamy—about 70°F) and add 1 teaspoon pure coconut extract along with the vanilla.\\nGingerbread: This variation has all the spicy complexity of a Christmas cookie, with the unique flavor and crunch of a classic graham. Make the dough with sorghum or unsulfured molasses (not blackstrap) and increase the cinnamon to 1 teaspoon. Along with the sugar, add 1 tablespoon orange zest, 2 teaspoons ground ginger, 1/8 teaspoon ground cloves, and a few cracks of black pepper.\\nGraham Cracker Crumb Crust: Combine 9 ounces (2 cups) finely ground graham cracker crumbs with 2 ounces (4 tablespoons) melted unsalted butter. Scatter into a 9-by-1 1/4-inch glass or ceramic pie plate and press into an even layer over the bottom and up the sides. Bake at 350°F until firm, about 18 minutes. Cool to room temperature for immediate use in your favorite recipe, or wrap tightly in plastic and refrigerate for up to 1 week.\\nGluten-Free: Replace the whole wheat flour with 6 ounces (11/4 cups) white rice flour, 4 ounces (1 cup plus 2 tablespoons) oat flour, and 1/2 ounce (1 tablespoon) kinako.</td>\n",

       "      <td>In a medium saucepan, warm the olive oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add the garlic, chili powder, and cumin. Cook until fragrant, stirring constantly, about 30 seconds. Add the tomato paste and sauté for another minute, stirring constantly. Add the rinsed quinoa and water, and stir to combine. Bring the mixture to a gentle boil, then cover the pot and reduce the heat as necessary to maintain a gentle simmer. Cook until the liquid is absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes (the quinoa might not be fluffy yet, but don’t worry).\\nRemove the pot from the heat and let it rest, still covered, for 5 minutes. Then, uncover and fluff the quinoa with a fork. Gently stir in the black beans and salt. Season to taste with pepper and additional salt, if necessary. Cover and set aside for a couple of minutes to warm up the beans.\\nIn a large skillet, warm the olive oil over medium heat until shimmering. Toss in the tortilla strips, sprinkle them with salt, and stir. Cook until the strips are crispy and turning golden, stirring occasionally, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain the tortilla strips on a plate covered with a piece of paper towel.\\nIn a small food processor or blender, combine the lime juice, olive oil, and water. Using a spoon, scoop in the half avocado and add the cilantro, jalapeño, garlic, and salt. Process until the dressing is nice and smooth. The dressing should be zippy, but if it’s unpleasantly tart or difficult to blend, dilute it with 1 to 2 tablespoons of water and blend again.\\nCombine the romaine and arugula in a large bowl. Wait to dress the salad until you are ready to serve, as the greens wilt fairly quickly once dressed. (If you won’t be consuming all 4 servings of this salad right away, portion off the greens you’d like to save for later, and dress only the greens you intend to eat now.)\\nWhen you’re ready, drizzle the mixture with just enough dressing to lightly coat the greens (you might have extra). Toss until the dressing is evenly distributed.\\nArrange the dressed greens in 4 individual salad bowls (or dinner plates, if your bowls are on the small side). Top each salad with taco filling, tomatoes, radishes, crispy tortilla strips, and feta. Slice the remaining avocado half into long strips and place a couple of strips on each salad. Serve immediately.\\nIf you have leftover dressing, press plastic wrap against the surface to prevent browning and store it in the refrigerator for later. Leftover tortilla strips tend to become unpalatably tough within a couple of hours, so you might want to skip those and add a few crushed tortilla chips to leftovers.</td>\n",

Melt 2 Tbsp. butter in a large high-sided skillet over medium-high heat. Add leeks and half of lemon zest, season with salt and pepper, and mix to coat leeks in butter. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and cook, stirring occasionally, until leeks are somewhat tender, about 5 minutes. Remove lid, increase heat to medium-high, and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender and just starting to take on color, about 3 minutes. Add rice and cook, stirring often, 3 minutes, then add broth, scraping up any browned bits. Tuck short sides of each chicken thigh underneath so they are touching and nestle seam side down into rice mixture. Bring to a simmer. Cover, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook until rice is tender and chicken is cooked through, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat. Cut remaining 1 Tbsp. butter into small pieces and scatter over mixture. Re-cover and let sit 10 minutes.\\nMeanwhile, pulse anchovy, garlic, capers, a few pinches of red pepper flakes, and remaining lemon zest in a food processor until finely chopped.

Toast them slowly, shaking the pan often, until lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove them from the skillet, and when they are cool enough to handle, roughly chop the nuts.\\nBring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the pasta until al dente. Drain it, reserving 1/2 cup of the cooking liquid and add it to a large bowl.\\nIn a large skillet, heat the butter over medium-low heat. Once the butter begins to foam, add the garlic and use a wooden spoon to stir the mixture constantly until the butter begins to brown and have a slight nutty aroma, about 5 minutes. Add the salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes. Give the mixture a good stir, and then set it aside to infuse for about 5 minutes longer away from the heat.\\nPour the butter mixture (scraping the garlic, salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes) all over the warm pasta. If the pasta feels a bit dry, add a touch of the reserved cooking liquid. Toss to combine and set aside.\\nSet the same skillet (without cleaning it) over medium-high heat. Add the chard stems and cook for 5 minutes. Add the chard leaves and continue to cook, tossing the mixture every so often, until the greens begin to wilt and turn bright green, 3 to 5 minutes longer. Add a touch more butter or oil to the pan if it dries out too much.\\nAdd the Swiss chard and hazelnuts to the pasta and toss it all together. Add the Parmesan shavings and the balsamic vinegar (if you’re using it); toss. Taste for seasonings and add more salt and pepper if needed.\\nServe warm or at room temperature.\\nLocalize it: You can use kale instead of chard, and any nut will work in place of the hazelnuts. Fresh out of balsamic vinegar? Red wine vinegar or freshly squeezed lemon juice will work.   \n",

Add the pork and turn to coat the meat. Cover and refrigerate overnight.\\nThe next day, set a large sauté pan over medium heat. Once it’s hot, add the pork, working in batches so as not to overcrowd the pan and leaving any liquid in the bowl. Cook, stirring occasionally and flipping the meat, until lightly caramelized and golden brown on both sides, about 10 minutes. (If you overcrowd the pan, the meat will steam instead of sear.) Transfer to a platter.\\nWhen the meat is cooked, open the buns, butter the interiors, and toast them until they are a light golden brown.\\nTo serve, spread both cut sides of each bun with a healthy smear of mayo and pile the spicy pork generously on the bottoms of the buns. Top with the sliced cucumbers. Serve immediately.\\nThe pork belly must be marinated overnight. You can also grill the pork on an outdoor grill over a high flame. The sugars in the marinade will char and caramelize, giving you a more interesting texture and flavor, but be careful not to burn the pork.   \n",

Add the potatoes and cook until tender, about 15 minutes.\\nAdd the sausage and cook until heated through, about 5 minutes. Add the corn and cook until just tender, about 3 minutes. Stir in the shrimp, scallops, and wine and cook until the shrimp are cooked through, about 4 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and pour the stew into a large serving bowl. For more casual gatherings, serve directly from the pot on the stove. Garnish each serving with cilantro and serve immediately.   \n",

Cut them into chunks and pass them through a juicer.\\nCombine the water and sugar in a pitcher and stir until the sugar has dissolved. Add the beet juice.\\nRefrigerate until completely chilled. Add the apple, banana, orange, and lettuce, then stir in the lime juice (which will help prevent the fruit from browning). Serve chilled over ice, if desired.\\nAlternately, divide the mixed diced fruit among the glasses; place the beet water in a pitcher for guests to pour over.   \n",

Measure out 1 cup. Puree the fruit and the 1 cup sugar water in a blender. Pour the mixture through a fine-mesh strainer back into the pitcher with the sugar water, mashing with a whisk or wooden spoon to eliminate any pulp.\\nTaste and add more sugar, if desired.

The mixture will thicken into mayonnaise consistency (unless high-butterfat cream is used). Gradually beat in the sugar. It should take about 30 seconds to incorporate it.\\nDetach the bowl and whisk beater from the stand. Add half the flour mixture to the cream mixture and, with the whisk attachment stir and fold in the flour until most of it disappears. Add the rest of the flour mixture and continue folding and mixing until all traces of flour have disappeared. Using a silicone spatula or spoon, scrape the batter into the prepared pan. Run a small metal spatula or dull knife blade through the batter to prevent large air bubbles, avoiding the bottom of the pan. Smooth the surface evenly with a small metal spatula.\\nBake for 25 to 35 minutes, or until a wooden toothpick inserted between the tube and the side comes out completely clean and the cake springs back when pressed lightly in the center. The cake should start to shrink from the sides of the pan only after removal from the oven.\\nLet the cake cool in the pan on a wire rack for 10 minutes. With a small metal spatula, loosen the top edges of the cake and invert the cake onto a wire rack that has been coated lightly with nonstick cooking spray. Cool completely. The cake requires no adornment, but I love to serve it with a light dusting of powdered sugar or a large dollop of lightly sweetened Whipped Cream.   \n",

Let soak, adding more hot water if needed, until floppy but still sturdy, about 1½ hours.\\nMeanwhile, place goji berries in a small bowl and pour in cold water to cover. Let soak until just softened, about 30 minutes, then drain.\\nDrain mushrooms, wrap in a clean dish towel, and squeeze out any excess liquid. Remove any woody parts from mushrooms and tear into smaller pieces if large. Wipe out bowl and place mushrooms back into bowl. Add goji berries and toss to combine.\\nWhisk garlic, oil, vinegar, and ¾ tsp. salt in a small bowl. Drizzle dressing over mushroom mixture and toss to coat. Let sit 10 minutes, then toss again.

Cover and bring to a boil. Remove from heat; set aside.\\nMeanwhile, tear cilantro, dill, and parsley (including stems) with your hands. Working in batches if needed, stuff into a food processor and process until finely chopped.\\nCombine onion and oil in a cold large high-sided skillet with a lid. Place over medium-high heat and cook, stirring and shaking pan occasionally, until onion is dark brown around the edges, 6–8 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring, until garlic is just barely golden, about 1 minute. Add turmeric and cook, stirring, 30 seconds. Add herbs and spinach (no need to defrost or drain) and cook, stirring often, until herbs are wilted and spinach is thoroughly defrosted, about 2 minutes. Add dried cilantro, pepper, 2½ tsp. salt, and reserved parcooked rice along with all of the water. Bring to a simmer, cover, and cook over medium-low heat until flavors come together, about 10 minutes.\\nRemove lid and continue to cook spinach mixture until greens are glossy and liquid is almost completely evaporated (dragging a rubber spatula or wooden spoon through the mixture should leave a trail with little to no liquid seeping back in), 6–8 minutes. Stir in lime juice; taste and season with more salt if needed.\\nMake 6 divots in mixture and crack an egg into each one (or, if making with egg whites only, separate out egg yolks first and reserve for another use). Working quickly, drag the tip of an offset spatula or butter knife through each egg once or twice to break up the yolks and encourage wisps of egg white to spread throughout the mixture (you want a marbled effect—don’t scramble). Cover pan and simmer until eggs are cooked to your liking, about 3 minutes for jammy. Serve with rice and smoked fish alongside if desired.   \n",

Add the flour mixture and mix until just blended. The batter should be quite thin. Add the chopped vegetables to the batter and mix well.Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a medium non- stick skillet over medium-high heat. Pour ¼ cup (60 ml) of the batter to make a 6-inch (15 cm) pancake. Cook until medium brown, about 1 minute. Place ¼ of the meat on top of the pancake and then flip the meat side down. Turn heat to low and cook until the bottom of the pancake is browned, the meat is thoroughly cooked, and the vegetables are tender—about 10 minutes. Repeat until the batter is used up.To serve, brush the pancake with mayonnaise and tonkatsu sauce, or soy sauce. Sprinkle with the bonito flakes and crumbled nori. Eat while piping hot.   \n",

Dutch oven or large heavy pot over medium until hot. Add onion and garlic and cook, stirring often, until onion is softened, 3–5 minutes. Add kimchi along with its juices and cook, stirring often, until kimchi begins to caramelize and stick to bottom of pot, 8–10 minutes. Add 4 cups water and increase heat to medium-high to bring to a boil. Reduce heat as needed to maintain a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until some of the liquid is evaporated and flavors have melded, about 15 minutes.\\nSpoon a few tablespoons of soup into a small bowl. Add miso and salt. Stir until miso loosens to a smooth sauce-like consistency, then stir back into soup (this helps avoid any lumps of undissolved miso).\\nAdd clams to soup. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until clams open, 5–7 minutes depending on size (discard any clams that do not open after 15 minutes). Mix in butter, then add tofu. Give soup one very gentle stir just to incorporate tofu (be careful not to break it up too much). Continue to cook soup, undisturbed, just until tofu is warmed through, 1–2 minutes. Taste and season with salt if needed.\\nDivide soup and clams among bowls. Top with scallions.   \n",

Slice 1 cabbage into 1\"-thick steaks. Cut the second cabbage in half (if using). Arrange on a large rimmed baking sheet and drizzle with oil. Turn steaks and halves and drizzle second sides with oil; season with 1 tsp. salt and 1/2 tsp. pepper. Arrange cabbage halves cut side down and roast until golden brown on the bottom and tender, 35–40 minutes. (Reserve cabbage halves for another use. Let cool, then cover and chill.)\\nMeanwhile, place chickpeas on another rimmed baking sheet and pat dry with a clean towel. Add cumin, 1/4 cup oil, 1 tsp. coriander, 1/2 tsp. salt, and 1/2 tsp. pepper and toss to combine. Roast, stirring once halfway through, until golden and crisp, 20–25 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl and set aside; reserve baking sheet (no need to wash).\\nTear bread into bite-size chunks. Whisk 1/4 cup oil, 1 grated garlic clove, 1 tsp. mustard, 2 Tbsp. chopped parsley, 1/2 tsp. salt, 1/4 tsp. pepper, and remaining 1/4 tsp. coriander in a large bowl to combine. Add torn bread and toss well to coat. As soon as chickpeas are done roasting, transfer bread to reserved baking sheet and roast until golden and crispy, 10–12 minutes.\\nWhisk mayonnaise, lemon juice, and remaining grated garlic, 1 Tbsp. oil, 1 tsp. mustard, and 1/2 tsp. pepper in a small bowl. Taste and season with salt if needed.\\nSmear mayonnaise sauce on plates and top with cabbage steaks. Top cabbage with chickpeas and croutons. Drizzle with more mayonnaise sauce, thinning with lemon juice or water if needed to make it pourable. Top with parsley leaves.   \n",

Grip a wing and pull it outward so you can see where it attaches to the body. Using a sharp boning or chef’s knife, cut though the joint to separate the wing from the breast (if you hit bone, you’re in the wrong spot; pull the wing out farther to help you get into the place where the joint meets the socket). Remove wing; repeat on the other side.\\nCut through skin connecting 1 leg to carcass. Pull leg back until the ball joint pops out of its socket; cut through the joint to separate leg. Repeat on the other side.\\nNow for the breast: Position the turkey breast side down with the opening facing you. Using kitchen shears, cut along one side of backbone until you get all the way through the neck end, then turn the turkey 180°F and cut through the other side to remove the backbone (save it for making stock).\\nVery finely grind black and pink peppercorns in a spice mill or mortar and pestle; transfer to a medium bowl. Add salt, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, and 1 Tbsp. brown sugar and use your fingers to mix together.\\nPlace turkey pieces, skin side up, on a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet. Sprinkle salt mixture liberally all over turkey, patting to adhere. You may not need all of it, but it’s good to have extra since some will end up on the baking sheet. Chill bird, uncovered, at least 24 hours and up to 2 days.\\nRemove turkey from wire rack and rinse baking sheet and rack if needed (turkey will most likely release some liquid). Line baking sheet with 3 layers of foil to make cleanup easy and set rack back inside. Arrange turkey pieces on rack, skin side up, and let sit at room temperature 2–3 hours to help decrease the cooking time.\\nMeanwhile, cook herbs, garlic, orange zest, soy sauce, vinegar, and remaining ⅓ cup brown sugar in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until sugar is dissolved and glaze thickens slightly (it should just barely coat a spoon), 10–12 minutes. Remove glaze from heat.\\nPlace a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 425°F. Rub turkey with oil and pour 1 cup water into baking sheet. Roast turkey, rotating baking sheet halfway through, until skin is mostly golden brown, 20–25 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 300°F and continue to roast turkey, brushing with glaze every 20 minutes and adding more water by ½-cupfuls as needed to maintain some liquid in baking sheet, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of breast registers 150°F, and 170°F when inserted into the thickest part of the thighs, 50–70 minutes longer (total cooking time will be 1–1½ hours). Skin should be deep golden brown and shiny. Transfer turkey to a cutting board; tent loosely with foil. Let rest 30–60 minutes before carving.   \n",

Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.\\nIn a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat together the butter, brown and granulated sugar, and vanilla on medium-low speed just until smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the peanut butter and mix until smooth. Beat in the egg. Reduce the speed to low, and gradually stir in the flour mixture until the dough comes together.\\nPlace level tablespoons of dough about 11/2 inches/4 cm apart on the prepared baking sheets, 20 per sheet (they don’t spread much). Using a small measuring spoon with a deep well, or a melon baller, make a 1-inch/2.5 cm-diameter divot in the center of each cookie. Bake the cookies just until they are firm and turning golden brown at the edges but still very soft in their centers, about 12 minutes, rotating the sheets from front to back and top to bottom about halfway through the baking time. As soon as the cookies come out of the oven, reinforce the indentations with whatever tool you used before. Let the cookies cool for 5 minutes on the pans, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.\\nPlace the chocolate and butter in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on HIGH in 30-second intervals, stirring well, until smooth. Let cool slightly. Transfer the ganache to a small resealable plastic bag and work it toward the corner of the bag. Snip off a tiny bit at the corner of the bag with scissors. Fill each divot with ganache.

Toast pistachios on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing halfway through, until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Let cool; set aside.\\nMeanwhile, bring a medium pot of water to a boil. Boil scallions, peppers, and carrot tops until peppers are tender, about 5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to a bowl of ice water and let cool. Drain and squeeze out as much excess water with your hands as possible. Transfer to a plate and chill in freezer 5 minutes (this will keep the dip bright green).\\nFinely grind nori in a blender; transfer to a small bowl. Wipe out blender, then blend vinegar, soy sauce, and reserved nuts in blender until nuts are coarsely chopped. Add chilled vegetable mixture and blend, streaming in oil, until very smooth (this may take up to 4 minutes, depending on your blender). If mixture seems thick, add 1 Tbsp. water to loosen.\\nTransfer dip to a bowl and sprinkle with nori powder. Serve with vegetables alongside for dipping.   \n",

Add pork; cover and chill at least 8–24 hours.\\nDrain pork (no need to rinse off koji if it sticks); set aside. Place cabbage in a medium bowl. Finely grate lemon zest over; slice lemons in half and squeeze in the juice. Season cabbage with salt. Using your hands, toss and squeeze cabbage until slightly wilted, about 5 minutes. Chill until ready to use.\\nPlace eggs, panko, and flour in 3 separate shallow bowls. Whisk 2 Tbsp. water into eggs. Line a rimmed baking sheet with paper towels and set a wire rack inside; place near stovetop. Working with 1 piece of reserved pork at a time, dredge in flour, shaking off excess. Dip in eggs, letting excess drip back into bowl, then coat in panko, pressing to adhere before shaking off excess. Transfer to another rimmed baking sheet or a platter.\\nPour oil into a medium heavy pot to come 2\" up sides. Heat oil over medium-high until an instant-read thermometer registers 350°–365°F. Carefully lower a piece of pork vertically into skillet, letting it slide away from you into oil until it eventually lies flat. Cook, using tongs to keep meat submerged in oil, until golden brown underneath, about 1 minute. Using tongs, carefully turn over and cook until golden brown on the other side, about 1 minute. Transfer to prepared baking sheet; immediately season with salt. Repeat with remaining pieces of pork.\\nDrizzle tonkatsu sauce over cutlets. Spread mustard on 1 side of half of bread slices; top with cabbage mixture, then cutlet, sauce side up. Close sandwiches and slice each into thirds.   \n",

(You can do this lengthwise, crosswise, or even diagonally. Knock yourself out with your decorative prowess!)\\nPlace the eggplant cut side up on a rimmed baking sheet and drizzle with ½ cup olive oil, distributing as evenly as possible. Season with salt and pepper and turn over so that the eggplant is cut side down.\\nPlace in the oven and roast, without moving or disturbing, until eggplant is completely tender, cooked through, and golden brown on the bottom (since the skin is already so dark, it can be hard to tell, but the skin will look shriveled and, when poked, the whole thing should feel tender, on the verge of collapse; you can also use a spatula to lift up the eggplant to check the underside for color), 40 to 45 minutes.\\nMeanwhile, heat the remaining ¼ cup olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic and chile and cook, shaking the skillet occasionally, until the garlic and chile are frizzled and fragrant (but not yet browned), 1 or 2 minutes. Add the bread and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, until the bread is evenly toasted and golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside.\\nCombine the labne, preserved lemon, and 1 tablespoon lemon juice in a small bowl; season with salt, pepper, and more lemon juice, if you like. Smear it onto the bottom of a large serving platter or in a shallow bowl.\\nOnce the eggplant is good and ready to go, use a fish spatula (or regular spatula) to lift up each eggplant half in one fell swoop, preserving its lovely golden underside. Place the eggplant, cut side up, on top of the seasoned labne. Scatter with the crispy croutons and herbs before serving.\\nEggplant can be roasted a few hours ahead, then kept loosely covered at room temperature (no need to reheat— it’s excellent at room temperature). The labne can be seasoned a week ahead, covered tightly, and refrigerated. The croutons can be made 2 days ahead, kept covered tightly at room temperature.   \n",

(Alternatively, finely grate garlic and finely chop rosemary. Combine in a small bowl and mix in the oil.) Season lamb chops on both sides with salt and black pepper. Coat all over with garlic paste and let sit at room temperature 30 minutes or cover and chill up to 12 hours.\\nJust before you are ready to grill the chops, make the herb salsa. Pound parsley and dill with mortar and pestle with a big pinch of salt until coarsely crushed. (Alternatively, finely chop the herbs and combine in a medium bowl.) Finely grate zest from lemon into herbs, then slice lemon in half and squeeze in its juice. Stir in 1/2 cup oil; taste and season herb salsa with more salt if needed.\\nPrepare a grill for medium-high heat. Grill lamb chops, turning often to encourage fat to render and moving to a new spot on the grill whenever there’s a flare-up, until nicely charred on the outside but still pink in the center, 6–8 minutes. Transfer to a platter and let rest 5–10 minutes.\\nWhile the chops are resting, toss peppers in a medium bowl with enough oil to coat; season with salt.

Place on a plate and sprinkle with cornstarch, turning to coat. Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high. Cook salmon in a single layer, undisturbed, until golden brown underneath, 2–3 minutes. Turn and cook until other side is lightly golden, about 2 minutes. Pour sauce over salmon and continue to cook, gently turning salmon halfway through, until sauce is thickened slightly and clinging to salmon, about 1 minute. (Sauce will bubble aggressively when first added and will then calm down.)\\nMeanwhile, set a steamer basket in a large pot filled with about 1\" salted water. Cover pot and bring water to a boil. Place bok choy in steamer basket, cover pot, and steam until just tender, 5–7 minutes. Season with remaining 1/2 tsp. salt.\\nPlace rice (if using) and bok choy on a platter. Arrange salmon over and drizzle bok choy and salmon with any remaining sauce in skillet. Top with scallions and sesame seeds.   \n",

Toss onion and vinegar in a small bowl to coat; set aside.\\nSqueeze tofu over a medium bowl, gently at first, then more firmly to expel as much water as possible (like squeezing out a big sponge). Don’t worry if it starts to crack apart. When no more liquid comes out, tear tofu into 1\" pieces. Arrange in a single layer on a large rimmed baking sheet. Toss with oil, then add coriander, paprika, red pepper flakes, cinnamon, and 1 tsp. salt. Toss well to coat. Roast tofu, turning once or twice, until crispy around the edges and well browned, 20–25 minutes (the tofu will get crispier as it cools, so don’t be tempted to take it too far and dry it out in the oven).\\nStir yogurt and garlic in a small bowl; season with salt. Assemble by dividing yogurt among pitas, followed by tofu, cucumbers, drained pickled onion, and a handful of mint.   \n",

(The cabbage might be done before the potatoes.)\\nMeanwhile, coarsely crush cloves, coriander seeds, mustard seeds, peppercorns, and red pepper flakes with mortar and pestle. Transfer to a small saucepan and cook over medium heat, swirling often, until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add garlic and remaining 3/4 cup oil and cook, stirring, until garlic sizzles, about 1 minute. Transfer to a medium heatproof bowl. Stir in vinegar, honey, and 2 tsp. salt. Let cool, then stir in dill.\\nTransfer beef to a cutting board and let sit 10 minutes. Trim off excess fat, then thinly slice against the grain. Serve alongside roasted cabbage and potatoes with dill sauce drizzled over.   \n",

Fill a large bowl with water and ice and set aside.\\nAdd 1 tablespoon kosher salt and the broccolini to the boiling water and cook until crisp-tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Using a spider or slotted spoon, transfer the Broccolini to the ice water to stop the cooking and let cool. Keep the pot of water boiling for the pasta. Drain the broccolini in a colander, cut the stalks in half crosswise, and set aside.\\nIn a large nonstick skillet over medium heat, heat the olive oil until shimmering. Add the garlic and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring frequently, for 1 minute. Add the blanched broccolini, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper and sauté until tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer the broccolini to a medium bowl and set aside.\\nAdd the pasta to the boiling water and cook until al dente, about 2 minutes less than the directions on the package. Reserve 1/2 cup of the pasta water and drain the pasta in a colander.\\nMeanwhile, wipe out the skillet, return it to medium-low heat, and add the butter. When the butter has melted, add the sage leaves and cook until the butter turns amber brown and the sage shrivels, 4 to 6 minutes. Add 1/4 teaspoon salt and black pepper. Stir in the cooked pasta until incorporated, then fold in the broccolini and 2 to 3 tablespoons of the reserved pasta water.\\nStir in the Parmesan cheese, adding more pasta water until you achieve desired creaminess. Season with salt and pepper and serve hot.   \n",

Add the sausages and fry for 10 to 15 minutes, until golden and cooked through. Add the bacon and fry for 3 to 4 minutes on each side, until crisp and golden, dabbing off any milky liquid with paper towels. Add the black and/or white pudding slices to the pan and fry for 2 to 3 minutes on each side, until beginning to crisp; the white pudding (if using) should turn golden. Remove the sausages, bacon, and pudding slices from the pan and drain on paper towels.\\nPlace in an ovenproof dish in a low oven to keep warm.\\nMeanwhile, add a dash of oil and pat (knob) of butter to another frying pan over medium heat. Add the button mushrooms and sauté for 3 to 4 minutes, until softened and turning golden. Season with salt and pepper, then remove from the pan and keep warm (adding to the dish with the sausages and bacon). If you are cooking a large flat mushroom, then add the oil and butter to the pan and fry the mushroom for 8 to 10 minutes, turning halfway through, until softened and browned.\\nSeason the cut side of the tomato halves with salt and pepper and drizzle over 1 tablespoon of oil. Gently fry them, cut side down first, for 2 to 3 minutes, then turn over and fry for another 2 to 3 minutes, until just softened.\\nAlternatively, cook the large flat mushroom and/or the tomatoes in the oven. Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C/Gas mark 6). Drizzle 2 teaspoons of olive oil over or add a pat (knob) of butter to the mushroom and season with salt and pepper before roasting for 12 to 15 minutes, until softened. If you are using the oven, begin roasting the mushroom and tomatoes a few minutes before frying the sausages and bacon. Once cooked, decrease the oven temperature to low for keeping everything warm as it is cooked.\\nTo fry an egg, melt a pat (knob) of butter in a small, clean frying pan over low heat. Carefully crack the egg into the pan and allow to fry gently. For an over-easy egg, fry for 1 to 2 minutes, until it begins to set, then flip over and fry for another 1 to 2 minutes. If you prefer your egg sunny side up, then fry gently for 4 to 5 minutes, until the yolk has filmed over. Remove from the pan and serve immediately with the other cooked ingredients.\\nFor scrambled eggs, crack the eggs into a bowl, add the milk, season with salt and pepper, and beat together. Add 1 tablespoon of the butter to a small saucepan over low heat. Immediately pour in the eggs and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring continuously (I find a wooden spatula best for this), until the butter has melted and the eggs are softly scrambled. Remove from the heat immediately so that the eggs don't become overcooked. Serve with the other cooked ingredients.\\nWhile the egg is cooking, put the slices of bread in a toaster or toast under a preheated broiler (grill) for a few minutes (and on both sides, if using the broiler/grill) until golden. Butter the toast and cut the slices in half.\\nTo serve, arrange everything on a warm serving plate, with the hot buttered toast on the side and with some tomato ketchup or relish.   \n",

Heat oil in a 6-quart stockpot or Dutch oven over medium, then add vegetables; season with 1 tsp. salt and 1/2 tsp. pepper, stirring to coat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables begin to look juicy, about 3 minutes. Partially cover with a lid, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are completely tender but have not taken on any color, 10–12 minutes.\\nAdd wheat berries, coriander, turmeric, and bay leaves and stir to combine. Cook until bottom of pot is just starting to brown, about 2 minutes. Add 10 cups water and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Season with 1 1/2 tsp. salt, then reduce heat to medium-low and bring to a simmer. Cook, uncovered and stirring occasionally, until grains show signs of softening but are nowhere near done, about 15 minutes. Add lentils and kale and stir well to combine. Kale should be submerged; add another cup of water if needed. Partially cover pot and cook, stirring occasionally, until lentils and grains are tender and kale is very silky, 40–45 minutes more. Pluck out bay leaves. Taste and season with more salt and pepper if needed.\\nDivide soup among bowls. Serve with Parmesan for sprinkling over and bread for dunking.   \n",

Stack 2–3 sheets of foil ample enough to cover ham on a work surface and arrange pineapple and orange slices on top in a single layer. Set ham on fruit (if using a bone-in ham and it has a fat cap, score very lightly, making cuts about 3/4\" apart) and wrap up tightly. Transfer to a wire rack set inside a large rimmed baking sheet and bake until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of ham registers 115°F, 3–3 1/2 hours for boneless, 3 1/2–4 hours for bone-in.\\nMeanwhile, bring pineapple juice, vinegar, brown sugar, and hot sauce to a boil in a large saucepan. Reduce heat; simmer, swirling occasionally, until thick enough to coat a spoon. Keep warm.\\nRemove ham from oven and increase oven temperature to 425°F. Unwrap ham, peeling back the foil so it covers the baking sheet (this will make for easy cleanup). Once oven is at 425°F, baste ham with warm glaze and return to oven. Bake, brushing with more glaze every 3 minutes or so, until glaze is deeply browned and thermometer registers 125°F, 12–15 minutes.

Add one-quarter (1 lb.) of the ground beef in an even layer, using your hands to break up large pieces and leaving some gaps to encourage browning (instead of steaming). Season with 1 tsp. salt. Cook, undisturbed, until bottom is deeply browned, about 3 minutes. Turn and break into smaller pieces and cook until the other side is browned, 2–3 minutes. Push over to one side of pot. Repeat with another one-quarter (1 lb.) of ground beef, seasoning uncooked meat with 1 tsp. salt. Using a wooden spatula or spoon, break meat into smaller pieces and stir to combine.\\nSeason remaining 2 lb. beef with 2 tsp. salt, then add to pot and cook over medium heat, stirring often and breaking into small pieces, until all meat is cooked through and most (but not all) of the liquid is evaporated from bottom of pot, 12–15 minutes. Let cool to room temperature.\\nGround beef can be made 5 days ahead. Divide among airtight containers and chill, or freeze up to 3 months.   \n",

Combine vinegar and 1/4 cup ice water in a small bowl and, with motor on low speed, stream into mixture. Beat, adding another 1–2 tsp. ice water if needed, until no dry spots remain. Continue to beat until dough begins to clump together, but stop before it starts to form a ball.\\nTransfer dough to a surface; squeeze and flatten a couple times to bring together. Divide into 4 pieces. Flatten into 1/2\"-thick disks; wrap tightly in plastic. Chill at least 1 hour and up to 2 days.\\nPlace a rack in middle of oven and preheat to 400°F. Whisk semolina flour, salt, 5 Tbsp. sugar, and 1 Tbsp. plus 1½ tsp. all-purpose flour in a medium bowl. Finely grate zest from grapefruit and orange into another medium bowl; set fruit aside.

Add dry ingredients; mix just until incorporated.\\nCut remaining peel and pith away from reserved citrus; discard. Slice fruit into 1/2\"-thick rounds; wriggle out seeds.\\nWorking one at a time, roll out dough disks on a lightly floured surface to 8\" rounds. Place on a parchment-lined baking sheet and spread 1/4 cup frangipane in the center of each, leaving a 1 1/2\" border. Arrange citrus rounds over frangipane to cover, then fold edges of dough up and over fruit. Chill 30 minutes.\\nBrush fruit and crust with melted butter and sprinkle with remaining 2 Tbsp. sugar (avoid getting it on the baking sheet). Bake crostatas, rotating once, until crusts are golden brown with a few darker spots, 40–45 minutes. Let cool at least 10 minutes before serving.   \n",

Let cool.\\nHeat remaining 1 Tbsp. oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Arrange brussels sprouts cut side down in skillet and cook, undisturbed, until well browned, about 4 minutes. Toss and continue to cook, tossing occasionally and reducing heat as needed, until browned all over, about 5 minutes longer. Reduce heat to medium; add butter, thyme, rosemary, and garlic. Tip skillet toward you so butter pools on one side and cook, spooning butter over brussels sprouts, until butter smells nutty, about 4 minutes; season with salt. Add vinegar and toss to coat. Cook just until vinegar and butter form a glaze over sprouts. Let cool; discard herbs.\\nCombine vinegar, mustard, lemon juice, and a big pinch of salt in a medium bowl. Finely grate in garlic and whisk to combine. Let sit 15 minutes.\\nMeanwhile, heat red pepper flakes, oregano, and 1/4 cup oil in a small saucepan over medium until oil is warm but not yet sizzling. Add remaining 2/3 cup oil to cool down infused oil.\\nPour infused oil into vinegar mixture; whisk until smooth.

Add kohlrabi, apple, and onion and toss to coat. Let sit while you cook the fish.\\nSwirl remaining 1 Tbsp. oil in a large nonstick skillet to coat. Season fish generously on both sides with salt and pepper and place, skin side down, in cold skillet. Set over medium heat and cook until fat starts to cook out of fish, about 4 minutes. Gently press on fillets with a spatula so skin makes good contact with pan, then keep pressing, cycling from one fillet to the next every few seconds, until skin starts to crisp. Continue to cook without pressing until skin is super crisp and flesh is mostly opaque, 8–10 minutes total (adjust heat as needed, but don’t rush it). Turn over; cook until completely opaque, about 1 minute. Place skin side up on plates.\\nWipe out skillet and return to medium heat. Cook hazelnuts and butter, swirling pan often, until butter foams, then browns, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in remaining 2 tsp. lemon juice; season brown butter sauce with salt and pepper.\\nToss kohlrabi salad and serve alongside fish fillets, leaving excess dressing behind. Spoon brown butter sauce over fish and salad and serve with lemon wedges for squeezing over.   \n",

Cover the bowl or container or seal the bag and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour and preferably overnight.\\nWhen you are ready to cook the meat, heat a grill pan over high heat or heat a charcoal or gas grill to medium.\\nReserving the marinade, thread 3 or 4 pieces of chicken on each skewer, letting the pieces touch slightly, and set them on a plate or baking sheet.\\nPour the marinade into a saucepan and bring it to a simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to medium and cook for 10 minutes; set it aside.\\nSpray the pan or grill grate lightly with cooking spray. Place the skewers on the grill pan or grill and cook, turning them and basting them often with the heated marinade, until they are cooked through or the center of a piece of chicken registers 165°F (75°C) on an instant-read thermometer. This should take between 8 and 15 minutes, depending on your cooking surface. (Discard any leftover marinade.)\\nTransfer to a platter and serve immediately, with sawsawan.   \n",

Drain the mushrooms, reserve the soaking liquid, and thinly slice the mushrooms. Combine the adobo and wine (if using) in a bowl.\\nHeat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large skillet or wok over medium heat until it shimmers. Add the garlic and stir-fry until light gold. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 2 minutes, or until translucent. Stir in the celery and bell pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 2 minutes. Add the adobo. If you are using fresh shrimp, add them, too. Cook, stirring, for about 1 minute. Remove from the heat and set aside.\\nPour the reserved mushroom soaking liquid into a saucepan and add the soy sauce, mushrooms, carrot, and chayote. If you are using dried shrimp, add those, too. Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat. Add the noodles and toss with the rest of the ingredients. As the noodles become tender, separate them until they are able to mix evenly with the veggies, about 3 minutes.\\nWhen the noodles have completely absorbed the liquid and are chewable, stir in the celery, bell pepper, and adobo mixture. Season with the black pepper and mix thoroughly. Pour in the remaining 1 tablespoon oil. Reduce the heat to low to gently fry the noodles for about 2 minutes. Serve with an extra dash of soy sauce and calamansi juice, if using.   \n",

Place the cubed butter in a small saucepan with the milk. Heat over a low heat until the cubes of butter have completely melted, then remove from the heat and set to one side to allow the mixture to cool for a few minutes.\\nPlace the flour in a large bowl, or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough-hook attachment, and add the yeast to one side of the bowl and the salt, sugar and cardamom to the other. If you put the salt directly on the yeast it may kill it, which will stop your dough from rising.\\nGradually pour the warm butter and milk into the bowl with the flour,mixing all the time, using your hands or the dough-hook attachment, until a sticky dough forms. You may not need to add all the milk mixture, or you might need to add a little more milk – you want to add just enough to make a sticky but not wet dough.\\nDust your worktop lightly with flour, tip the dough out on to it and knead it for 5–10 minutes (or knead using the dough hook on the stand mixer) until the dough is no longer sticky and has become smooth and elastic. Grease the bowl in which you mixed the dough with oil, place the dough back in the bowl, cover with a tea towel or cling film and leave to rise at room temperature for 1–3 hours or until doubled in size. You can leave the dough to prove in the fridge overnight if you want these for breakfast!\\nWhile the dough is rising, combine the filling ingredients in a small bowl to make a thick paste. Line 2 baking trays with baking parchment.\\nTip the risen dough out of the bowl on to a worktop lightly dusted with flour and fold it in on itself a couple of times to knock out any large air pockets.\\nRoll out the dough thinly to make a very large rectangle measuring roughly 50 x 30cm. Spread the cardamom filling mixture all over the dough, making sure it goes right to the edges.\\nFold one of the short ends over two-thirds of the dough, then fold the remaining third over – as if you are folding a letter or making puff pastry. You should have one neat rectangle consisting of three layers of dough, and all the filling should be enclosed inside.\\nUse a sharp knife to cut the dough into 12 even strips. Taking one of the strips, stretch out and twist it a few times. Tie it into a loose knot, tucking the edges in. Place the knot on a lined baking tray and repeat with the remaining strips, arranging them on the tray and leaving a few centimeters between each. Leave for 45 minutes at room temperature to rise again.\\nWhile the knots are proving, preheat the oven to 400°F/200°C/180°C fan/gas 6. Make the cardamom syrup by bringing the sugar, ground cardamom and 50ml of water to the boil in a small saucepan and letting it bubble for a few minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sugar has dissolved. Remove from the heat.\\nBake the buns for 15–20 minutes or until golden brown, then brush with the cardamom syrup as soon as they come out of the oven. Sprinkle with pearl sugar, if you wish, and serve warm.   \n",

Toast coconut on a rimmed baking sheet until golden brown, 3–5 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes.\\nPlace graham crackers in a large resealable plastic bag, seal, and crush to fine crumbs with a rolling pin or heavy pot. Transfer to a medium bowl. Add toasted coconut, coconut oil, and salt and mix well. Mixture will look quite crumbly and dry at this point, but it will come together as it chills.\\nLightly coat a 9\" pie dish with nonstick spray. Transfer graham cracker mixture to pie dish and press evenly and very firmly across bottom and up sides of dish with a flat-bottomed measuring cup (make sure crust extends all the way up to the lip of the dish). Chill until ready to fill (at least 20 minutes).\\nWhile the crust is chilling, remove coconut ice cream from containers (just peel away container if it’s paper, or use a rubber spatula to help slide ice cream out intact if container is plastic). Cut ice cream into 2\" pieces and place in a medium bowl. Repeat with strawberry ice cream, placing in a separate medium bowl. Let sit until slightly softened, about 5 minutes, then stir each, separately, with a large rubber spatula or wooden spoon until the consistency of thick cake batter. Transfer bowls to freezer and chill ice cream 10 minutes.\\nRemove ice cream from freezer. Scrape strawberry ice cream into bowl with coconut ice cream. Fold together a couple of times with spatula until swirled. Don’t overmix; you want thick marbled ribbons. Chill in freezer 10 minutes.\\nScrape marbled ice cream into crust. Using a large spoon, create deep decorative swirls in ice cream (the strawberries will be poured into these divots later). Freeze until ice cream is very firm, at least 6 hours.\\nToss strawberries, lemon juice, and sugar in a medium bowl. Let sit at least 35 minutes and up to 1 hour.\\nRemove pie from freezer and lower the bottom of the pie dish into a shallow bowl of warm water; hold it there 5 minutes (this will help slices release more easily). Spoon strawberries into divots; if you run out of places to contain them, reserve extras for serving.\\nRunning the blade of a chef’s knife under hot water and wiping dry before first cut and repeating as needed between cuts (this will give you neat sides), slice pie into wedges. Serve with any remaining strawberries alongside.\\nPie (without berries) can be made 1 week ahead. Cover with plastic wrap once hardened and keep frozen.   \n",

Set dressing aside.\\nWorking in batches, place green beans in a large resealable plastic bag. Seal bag and whack beans with a rolling pin to split the skins and soften the insides without completely pulverizing the flesh. Place in bowl with reserved dressing. Toss, massaging with your hands to break beans down further and coat. Let sit at room temperature at least 1 hour.\\nThinly slice radishes lengthwise. Place in a large bowl of ice water, cover, and chill until ready to serve (this will allow you to get the prep out of the way and keep the radishes crisp and firm).\\nJust before serving, drain radishes and toss with marinated green beans. Add pistachios; taste salad and season with pepper if needed. Transfer to a platter and drizzle with oil and sprinkle with sea salt.\\nUsing 2 spatulas, carefully transfer salmon to another platter, leaving skin behind on baking sheet. Drizzle with oil and squeeze juice from a lemon wedge or two over; sprinkle with sea salt.

Let soak 10 minutes.\\nMeanwhile, mix turmeric, pepper, 1 tsp. salt, and 1 tsp. brown sugar in a small bowl; set aside.\\nWorking one at a time, place pork chop flat on a work surface. First, butterfly the pork chop so that it’s thinner, which will reduce cooking time and create more surface area for seasoning. Using a sharp knife and starting from an outside edge, slice three-quarters of the way through the center of chop, as though you’re slicing a bagel in half, then open it up like a book. Place butterflied chop between 2 sheets of plastic wrap or inside a heavy-duty resealable plastic bag and pound to 1/4\" thin. Repeat with remaining chop. Rub chops with turmeric mixture and let sit 10 minutes.\\nCook vermicelli according to package directions. Run under cold water to stop the cooking, then transfer to a large bowl.\\nAdd basil, chiles, lime zest and juice, and remaining 1 1/2 tsp. brown sugar and 3/4 tsp. salt to cashews and cashew soaking water in blender and purée until smooth and creamy. Pour sauce over noodles and toss to combine.\\nHeat oil in a large heavy skillet over high until shimmering. Cook cutlets one at a time until browned and cooked through, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest 5 minutes.

You will notice it’s made up of a few muscle groups, separated by thin strips of fat and gaps where the bones have been removed. Use a sharp knife to separate the shoulder into smaller pieces along these natural seams—you should end up with 5 or 6 pieces of various sizes. Transfer lamb to a glass baking dish and season generously on all sides with salt and pepper.\\nPulse onions, rosemary leaves, and oregano leaves in a food processor until finely chopped; set remaining rosemary sprigs aside. Add vinegar and oil and pulse until a coarse purée forms. Season marinade with salt and pepper, then pour over lamb, turning to coat. Cover and let sit at room temperature 2–3 hours.\\nMix yogurt, lemon juice, and garlic in a medium bowl. Season sauce with salt and pepper; cover and chill until ready to use.\\nAbout half an hour before you plan to start grilling, slice tomatoes into 1/2\"-thick rounds and arrange on a large platter. Season with salt and pepper and drizzle with half of lemon juice. Top with onion, season with salt and pepper, and drizzle remaining lemon juice over. Arrange reserved rosemary sprigs on top; set aside.\\nPrepare a grill for medium heat. Without scraping off marinade, transfer larger pieces of lamb to grate and grill until underside is very well browned, about 5 minutes. Spoon some remaining marinade over lamb, turn, and continue to grill, turning every 5 minutes or any time you see a flare-up, until lamb is charred in spots and very well browned everywhere.\\nAfter large pieces have been cooking about 15 minutes, add smaller pieces to grill and follow same instructions; they take less time to cook, and by staggering the start times, all the lamb will come off the grill within a few minutes of each other. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of each piece should register 140°F for medium, which is ideal. Start checking smaller pieces after 7–10 minutes. The largest piece will take closer to 30 minutes. As each piece finishes, transfer to reserved platter, setting on top of rosemary. Let rest 20–30 minutes.\\nTransfer lamb to a cutting board and tuck rosemary sprigs off to sides of platter. Tip platter so that accumulated tomato and lamb juices pool at one end and spoon over tomatoes. Using a long sharp knife, slice lamb into very thin pieces and arrange on top of onion and tomatoes. Season with salt and drizzle with oil.\\nDrizzle yogurt sauce with oil and serve alongside lamb.\\nLamb can be seasoned 1 day ahead; cover and chill. Sauce can be made 8 hours ahead; keep chilled.   \n",

Add pancetta and cook, stirring often, until starting to crisp, about 10 minutes. Add onion, carrot, celery, and garlic and cook, stirring, until onion is softened, 8–10 minutes. Add ground beef and ground pork and cook, stirring often, until meat is fully cooked, 8–10 minutes.\\nCarefully lift insert out of pressure cooker with a potholder and strain through a fine-mesh sieve set over a medium bowl. Return meat mixture to cooker insert; discard fat. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in tomato paste and cook, stirring, about 2 minutes. Pour in wine and cook until reduced by half. Stir in stock, milk, and bay leaves. Lock on lid, making sure steam-release valve is in the proper sealed position. Select “Manual” and program for 10 minutes at high pressure (it will take about 5 minutes for the pressure to build before cooking automatically begins).\\nAs soon as the time has elapsed, let pressure release naturally (this will take about 15 minutes). Unlock lid and stir in cream. Continue to cook, stirring often, until sauce is thick, 10–15 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper.\\nMeanwhile, cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until al dente. Drain.\\nDivide pasta among bowls.

Drain the noodles and place them in a large bowl filled with ice and water to serve. Your sōmen noodles will be the highlight of the table, so serve them up in a gorgeous bowl.\\nServe family-style in the middle of your table. Using tongs or chopsticks, place the noodles into individual bowls, shaking off any residual water before serving.\\nAdd your choice of sauces and toppings. I usually top with a touch of shōyu and rice vinegar, and offer a variety of toppings— negi, katsuobushi, arugula, tofu, avocado slices, etc.   \n",

Cover and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer, still covered, stirring occasionally, until hominy starts to soften (some skins will split), about 1 hour.\\nSprinkle pork all over with cumin and remaining 1 Tbsp. salt. Add to pot along with garlic; pour in water to cover by 1\". Partially cover pot and cook, stirring occasionally and adding more water as needed to keep ingredients covered, until hominy is tender (some may unfurl like popped popcorn, and that’s okay) and pork is fall-apart tender, about 2 1/2 hours.\\nWhile the posole is cooking, make the chile purée. Wearing gloves if you have them, remove stems from chiles and shake out and discard most of the seeds (for more heat, keep more seeds). Transfer to a large bowl and add onion and garlic; pour in boiling water to cover. Let sit until chiles are softened, about 30 minutes.\\nDrain chile mixture, reserving soaking liquid, and transfer chiles, onion, and garlic to a blender. Add vinegar, brown sugar, 1 tsp. salt, and 1 cup soaking liquid and blend until smooth.\\nWhen posole is done, remove pork, onions, and bay leaves from pot (keep posole simmering). Transfer pork to a plate; discard onions and bay leaves. Let pork cool slightly, then pick meat from bones, discarding any cartilage and larger pieces of fat. Shred meat into bite-size pieces and return to pot; discard bones.\\nStir chile purée into posole and let simmer 30 minutes to allow flavors to meld. Taste and season with more salt.\\nDivide posole among bowls. Serve with avocado, cilantro, cabbage, jalapeños, radishes, lime wedges, sour cream, tortilla chips, and hot sauce alongside for topping.\\nPosole can be made 4 days ahead. Let cool, then cover and chill.   \n",

Reduce heat to medium-low and continue to cook, lifting up once or twice to let hot fat run underneath, until skin is evenly golden brown and crisp, about 12 minutes.\\nMeanwhile, whisk soy sauce, mirin, and sake in a small bowl.\\nTransfer chicken skin side up to a plate. Wipe out skillet and increase heat to medium. Pour in soy sauce mixture and cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened slightly, about 4 minutes. Return chicken to pan, arranging skin side up, and cook, adding a splash of water if sauce looks too thick, until underside is cooked through, about 1 minute. Turn thighs skin side down and continue to cook until warmed through and coated, about 1 minute more. Transfer chicken to a cutting board and slice into 1/2\" strips; set teriyaki sauce in skillet aside.\\nToss radishes, scallions, and vinegar in a small bowl. Season with remaining 1/2 tsp. salt.\\nPlace rice on a platter and arrange chicken over. Drizzle with reserved teriyaki sauce and top with radish salad.   \n",

Add lamb and seal bag, pressing out air. Turn bag to coat lamb, then put bag in a shallow baking pan and marinate, chilled, turning bag over occasionally, at least 8 hours.\\nBring lamb to room temperature, about 1 hour, before grilling.\\nPrepare grill for cooking over direct heat with medium-hot charcoal (moderate heat for gas); see Grilling Procedure.\\nRemove lamb from marinade (discard marinade) and run 3 or 4 skewers lengthwise through lamb about 2 inches apart. Grill on a lightly oiled grill rack, covered only if using gas grill, turning over occasionally and, if necessary, moving around on grill to avoid flare-ups, until thermometer registers 125 to 128°F, 8 to 14 minutes total for medium-rare.\\nTransfer lamb to a cutting board and remove skewers. Let lamb stand, loosely covered with foil, 20 minutes. (Internal temperature will rise to 135°F while meat stands.) Cut across the grain into slices.   \n",
       "1048                                                                                                                                                                                            Whisk cocoa, sugar, salt, and 1 2/3 cups flour in a medium bowl. Add butter and toss to coat. Using your fingers, smash butter into dry ingredients until it nearly disappears (you shouldn’t see any large bits) and mixture holds together when squeezed—you’re working it more than you would pie dough. Make a well in the center and add yolk and milk. Using a fork, gradually incorporate flour mixture until you’ve got a shaggy dough. Knead a couple of times in bowl until no dry spots remain and dough is smooth. Flatten into a 3/4\"-thick disk, wrap tightly in plastic, and chill until firm, about 2 hours. (You can make the caramel filling during this time.)\\nPreheat oven to 350°F. Let dough sit 5 minutes to soften slightly. Roll out on a lightly floured surface to a 14\" round about 1/8\" thick, dusting with more flour as needed to prevent sticking. Lift dough on one edge and throw a pinch of flour on surface. Slide bottom of tart pan under dough, positioning it roughly in the center. Fold in edges of dough so it’s resting fully on insert; place inside tart ring and unfold edges so they gently slump against sides of pan and excess dough is hanging over the edges. Press dough firmly into bottom of pan with floured hands, then use a straight-sided measuring cup to firmly press sides of dough into grooves and up sides of pan. Roll pin over top edge of pan to shear off excess dough flush with pan. Reserve dough scraps for patching any potential cracks later. Prick bottom of dough all over with a fork and chill in freezer until very firm, 10–15 minutes.\\nPlace tart pan on a rimmed baking sheet and line with a sheet of parchment paper or foil. Fill with pie weights or dried beans and bake until edges of crust are set and starting to look dry, 12–15 minutes. Carefully lift parchment with weights. Patch any visible cracks with reserved dough. Return crust to oven and bake until firm and dry all over, 18–22 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool.\\nBring sugar, cream of tartar, and 1/3 cup water to a boil in a large saucepan over medium-low, stirring with a heatproof spatula until dissolved. Cook, swirling pot often but not stirring, until mixture turns deep amber and wisps of smoke rise from the surface, 8–10 minutes. Remove caramel from heat and immediately stir in butter a piece at a time until smooth (be careful; mixture will sputter). Gradually stir in cream, then add salt. Transfer caramel to a heatproof measuring glass (you should have about 1 1/2 cups). Let cool until warm.\\nPour caramel into cooled tart shell. Chill until caramel is set, at least 1 hour.\\nPlace chocolate, cream, and butter in a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water (bowl should not touch water). Stir with a heatproof spatula until ganache is smooth, about 5 minutes. Let cool until thickened enough to hold an indentation from a spoon.\\nRemove tart from refrigerator and scrape ganache over caramel. Using a spoon, gently work ganache over surface, creating decorative swooshes and swirls. Sprinkle with sea salt; let sit until ganache has lost its sheen, 10–15 minutes.\\nDough can be made 2 days ahead; keep chilled. Crust can be baked 1 day ahead. Store tightly wrapped at room temperature. Caramel filling can be made 3 days ahead; cover and chill. Microwave in 20-second intervals, stirring in between, just until pourable.

Place pork shoulder, fat side down, on a cutting board with a short end facing you. Holding a long, sharp knife about 1\" above cutting board, make a shallow cut along the entire length of a long side of roast. Continue cutting deeper into the roast, lifting and unfurling meat with your free hand, until it lies flat (be careful not to cut all the way through). Season generously on both sides with salt.\\nMix eggs, chopped garlic, panko, parsley, rosemary, black pepper, red pepper flakes, and 3 oz. Parmesan in a medium bowl. Keeping fattier side of pork shoulder facing downward, smear filling all over top side. Roll up roast and tie closed in 3–4 places with kitchen twine.\\nHeat oil in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium-high. Sear pork roast until browned all over, 10–12 minutes total. Arrange tomatoes and their juices and sliced garlic all around roast and bring to a simmer. Make sure roast is turned fat side up, cover pot, and transfer to oven. Roast until a skewer easily passes through meat (a thermometer inserted into the center should register 200–205°F), 4–5 hours. Keep covered and let rest in pot 30 minutes.\\nTransfer pork roast to a cutting board and remove kitchen twine. Gently mash sauce in pot with a spoon or a potato masher (simmer it gently to thicken, if desired). Taste ragù and season with salt if needed. Slice pork 1\" thick.\\nMeanwhile, cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until al dente; drain.\\nSpoon pasta into a serving dish and top with some ragù; toss to coat. Sprinkle with finely grated Parmesan. Transfer pork to a platter; spoon remaining ragù over.\\nPork can be stuffed and rolled 2 days before roasting; cover and chill. Pork can be roasted 3 days ahead; let cool, then cover and chill. Reheat gently in sauce before serving.   \n",

Add the maple syrup, Instacure, mustard seeds, peppercorns, 1/2 teaspoon of the caraway seeds, the allspice berries, bay leaves, and 1/2 cup salt. Cook for 3 minutes at a rapid boil; then remove from the heat. Add the ice and wait for the brine to cool to room temperature.\\nPlace the brisket in a large container and cover it fully with the brine. (If you have an extra-large sealable plastic bag, those work really well, keeping the meat fully immersed in the brine.) Cover with a lid or plastic wrap and store in the refrigerator for 1 week.\\nAfter that week, remove the brisket from the brine and strain the brine, saving the spices and bay leaves and discarding the liquid. Set the brisket aside on a plate.\\nPreheat a large slow cooker on the low setting for at least 20 minutes.\\nIn large skillet, warm the olive oil over medium-high heat. When the oil begins to shimmer, add the onions and cook for 15 minutes, turning them once in a while, until they are well browned and a touch charred.\\nPlace the brisket in the slow cooker and add the charred onions, miso, garlic, 1 tablespoon of the butter, and the strained spices and bay leaves. Add enough room-temperature water to cover the brisket by 2 inches. Cover with the lid and cook on the low setting for 8 to 10 hours, until the brisket is really tender—a paring knife should plunge into the meat with little resistance. Skim off any fat that has risen to the surface.\\nPlace a large skillet over medium-high heat and add the remaining 1 tablespoon butter. When it begins to bubble and froth, add the cabbage, remaining 1/2 teaspoon caraway seeds, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Stir to combine; then let the cabbage char for 2 minutes to develop some color. Toss the cabbage and cook for another 2 minutes. Then transfer it to a large platter.\\nRemove the brisket from the slow cooker, taking care to keep it in one piece. Place it on top of the cabbage on the platter, let it rest for 5 minutes, and then slice it into 1/2-inch-thick slabs, against the grain. It will be very tender, and it may fall apart. That’s okay. We want that. Add the potatoes to the platter. Garnish with the fresh dill and the Pickled Mustard Seeds.   \n",

Add the shiitake slices, spreading them evenly around the pan. Now leave those mushrooms alone! Do not touch them until that sizzling sound quiets down; this will help them develop a beautiful golden brown caramelization on one side. Once that happens, give the pan a stir with a wooden spoon, loosening all the mushrooms. Cook for a few minutes more and season with a pinch of sea salt. (Do not salt until the end, as salting draws out moisture in the pan and prevents caramelization.) Remove the mushrooms from the pan and set aside in a bowl or plate to cool.\\nTrim the kale off of its stem and cut into thin strips. In a medium sauté pan, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and red onion. When the garlic is slightly browned, add the kale and sauté until soft, 3 to 4 minutes. (Add a small amount of water if the kale begins to stick or turn too brown.) Season with a pinch of sea salt and set aside with the mushrooms.\\nPreheat the oven to 325°F. Place a large shallow nonstick ovenproof dish in the oven.\\nIn a bowl, whip the eggs with a whisk until fully beaten and slightly fluffy. Stir in the kefir, 1/2 cup of the olive oil, the farmer cheese, cooked mushrooms, sautéed kale, chopped herbs, and 2 pinches of salt. Pour the entire mixture into the heated ovenproof dish, and bake until slightly browned on top and a knife stuck in the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes. (If opting for the kale garnish, add the leaves after 15 minutes of cooking.)   \n",

Cook, stirring frequently, for about 5 minutes, until the onions are softened. Add the remaining broth, tomatoes, tomato sauce, potatoes, refried beans, bay leaf, parsley, basil, oregano, and black pepper. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, cover, and simmer for 25 minutes, stirring occasionally to smooth out the refried beans. Add the kidney beans, corn, and whole wheat elbows. Continue to cook for 20 minutes. Stir in the chard and balsamic vinegar and cook an additional 10 minutes until the chard is softened. Remove the bay leaf before serving.   \n",

Add the butter and pulse for a few seconds more, until the mixture has the texture of fresh breadcrumbs. Add the cream cheese and process just until the dough comes together in a ball around the blade; be careful not to overprocess or the pastry will be tough. Tip the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and knead for a few seconds, just to bring it together.\\nDivide the pastry in two, cover each half loosely in plastic wrap, then press to flatten into disks. Transfer to the fridge for 1 hour.\\nPreheat the oven to 350°F/180°C. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside.\\nTo make the filling, spread the walnuts out on a rimmed baking sheet and roast for 5 minutes. Remove from the oven, set aside to cool, then chop finely and place in a small bowl with the brown sugar and cinnamon. Mix together and set aside.\\nIn a separate bowl, combine the quince paste and lemon juice to form a smooth paste. (If your quince paste is very firm, warm it gently over low heat to soften [or heat for 10 seconds in a microwave], until the texture is thick like jam but spreadable, then set aside to cool before using).\\nTake one of the pieces of dough from the fridge and roll out on a lightly floured work surface to form a 9 1/2-inch/24-cm circle, about 1/8 inch/3 mm thick. Use a small spatula or the back of a spoon to spread half of the quince paste evenly over the surface and then sprinkle with half of the sugar-nut mixture. Using a sharp knife or a pizza wheel, if you have one, cut the dough as though you are slicing a cake into twelve equal triangles. The best way to get even-sized triangles is to cut it first into quarters, then each quarter into thirds. One at a time, roll each wedge quite tightly, starting from the wide outside edge and working toward the point of the triangle, so that the filling is enclosed. Place them on the lined baking sheets, seam side down, spaced about 1 inch/3 cm apart. Repeat the rolling process with the remaining disk of dough and filling, then chill the rugelachs in the fridge for 30 minutes before baking.\\nIncrease the oven temperature to 400°F/200°C.\\nWhen ready to bake, lightly brush the tops of the rugelachs with the beaten egg and sprinkle with the demerara sugar. Bake for 20–25 minutes, rotating the sheets halfway through, until golden brown all over. Don’t worry if some of the filling oozes out; this will add a lovely toffee taste to the edges of the cookies. Remove from the oven and allow to rest on the sheets for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.\\nThe pastry can be made a day ahead and kept in the fridge, or frozen for up to 3 months (remember to thaw it overnight in the fridge before using). The rolled rugelach can also be frozen (before glazing) for up to 3 months. When you are ready to bake them, brush with the glaze and bake from frozen, adding an extra minute or two to the cooking time.\\nThese will keep for up to 4 days in an open container, separated by pieces of parchment paper, and the whole thing wrapped loosely in aluminum foil. Don’t keep in an airtight container; the sugar will weep if you do and turn the rugelach soft and sticky.   \n",

       "1234  Combine sugar, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, vanilla, golden syrup, and butter in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix on low speed to moisten, then increase to medium and beat until somewhat light, about 3 minutes. Reduce speed to low, add whole wheat flour, and mix to form a soft dough.\\nScrape dough onto a work surface and knead gently to form a ball. Divide in half. Use immediately or wrap in plastic and refrigerate for up to 1 week; soften for 30 minutes at room temperature, then knead on a bare work surface until pliable and smooth.\\nAdjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 350°F. Generously flour a large sheet of parchment and place one portion of dough in the center. Pat into a 5-by-6-inch rectangle, sprinkle with flour, flip, and dust again. Working from the center out and adding more flour as needed, roll the dough until roughly 15-by-11 inches and very thin. Slide onto an aluminum baking sheet and brush away excess flour. Repeat with remaining dough.\\nFor grocery store look-alikes, score each sheet of dough into twelve 2 1/4-by-4 3/4-inch rectangles and dock with a bamboo skewer or the narrow end of a chopstick (a strictly cosmetic procedure). Otherwise, leave the dough uncut.\\nBake until crackers are tawny brown and firm, though your fingertip may leave a faint indentation, about 20 minutes. Immediately cut along the pre-scored lines with a knife, or cut into free-form shapes using a pizza wheel. Cool to room temperature directly on the baking sheets. Enjoy scrap pieces as a snack, or pulverize into crumbs. The grahams can be stored in an airtight container for up to 3 weeks at room temperature or frozen for up to 3 months.\\nChocolate: My mom used to sandwich chocolate graham crackers with peanut butter for an after-school snack, a combo I re-create by reducing the whole wheat flour to 10 ounces (21/4 cups), sifted with 1 ounce (1/3 cup) natural or Dutch-process cocoa powder. To retain their deep cocoa color, roll the dough in sifted cocoa powder. Serve with generous smears of peanut butter and a tall glass of milk.\\nCinnamon Sugar: We rarely had sugar-coated grahams in our pantry when I was a kid, but they were always at my best friend’s house, and seemed all the more special for their rarity. For the dough, increase the cinnamon to ½ teaspoon. Before docking, dust each sheet of dough with a half batch of Cinnamon Sugar (page 44), or any Sugar Sprinkle (page 46). Otherwise, dock and bake as directed. After the crackers cool, gently tap each against the baking sheet to knock off any excess sugar.\\nCoconut (vegan): Replace the butter with 5 1/2 ounces (3/4 cup) virgin coconut oil (solid but creamy—about 70°F) and add 1 teaspoon pure coconut extract along with the vanilla.\\nGingerbread: This variation has all the spicy complexity of a Christmas cookie, with the unique flavor and crunch of a classic graham. Make the dough with sorghum or unsulfured molasses (not blackstrap) and increase the cinnamon to 1 teaspoon. Along with the sugar, add 1 tablespoon orange zest, 2 teaspoons ground ginger, 1/8 teaspoon ground cloves, and a few cracks of black pepper.\\nGraham Cracker Crumb Crust: Combine 9 ounces (2 cups) finely ground graham cracker crumbs with 2 ounces (4 tablespoons) melted unsalted butter. Scatter into a 9-by-1 1/4-inch glass or ceramic pie plate and press into an even layer over the bottom and up the sides. Bake at 350°F until firm, about 18 minutes.

Heat a dry medium skillet, preferably cast iron, over medium. Cook pork chops, moving once or twice to hotter areas of skillet, until first side is deeply browned, 6–9 minutes. Turn pork chops and cook until second sides are browned, about 5 minutes. Working one at a time, set chops on fatty side with tongs to melt and brown fat cap, about 1 minute each. At this point an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of each chop should register 135°F.\\nAdd thyme, garlic, and butter to skillet and swirl to melt butter. Tilt skillet toward you so butter pools in the pan and spoon foaming butter over chops continuously until butter is browned, about 1 minute. Transfer pork chops, thyme, and garlic to a cutting board and let meat rest while you assemble the salad.\\nCombine shallot and a couple of pinches of salt in a large bowl. Pour vinegar from reserved cranberries into bowl. Whisking constantly, gradually add remaining 3 Tbsp. oil.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.\\nPop out the stems of the mushrooms and discard. Wipe the mushroom caps clean with a damp paper towel and place round side down on the prepared baking sheet and set aside.\\nCombine the bread crumbs, nutritional yeast, parsley, garlic, lemon zest, salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons of the oil in a bowl.\\nUsing a teaspoon measure, stuff each mushroom cap with a heaping mound of the bread crumb filling. Lightly drizzle the mushrooms with the remaining oil. Bake until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer to a serving platter and serve immediately.\\nThe mushrooms can be cleaned and stemmed, and the bread crumb filling made, up to a day in advance and stored in airtight containers in the fridge. That way all you have to do before the party is stuff and bake them!   \n",

(We use 1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or 1/2 tsp. Morton kosher salt per lb.) Tie legs together with kitchen twine. Let sit 1 hour to allow salt to penetrate, or chill, uncovered, up to 1 day ahead.\\nPlace a rack in upper third of oven and set a 12\" cast-iron skillet or 3-qt. enameled cast-iron baking dish on rack. Preheat oven to 425°F. Once oven reaches temperature, pat chicken dry with paper towels and lightly coat with half of the oil. Drizzle remaining oil into hot skillet (this helps keep the chicken from sticking and tearing the skin). Place chicken in skillet and roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of breasts registers 155°F, 50–60 minutes (temperature will climb to 165°F as chicken rests). Let chicken rest in skillet at least 20 minutes and up to 45 minutes.Transfer chicken to a cutting board and carve legs off, followed by breasts.   \n",

Whisk egg, grated garlic, miso, milk, berbere, and 1 tsp. salt in a large bowl. Mix in Pecorino and panko. Add beef and currants and gently mix with your hands just until all ingredients are evenly incorporated (be careful not to overmix).\\nWorking one at a time, scoop out 2 heaping Tbsp. (about 1 1/2 oz.) mixture and roll into balls between your palms. Place on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet, spacing 2\" apart (you should end up with about 15). Bake meatballs until lightly browned on top and cooked through, 20–25 minutes.\\nMeanwhile, place kale in a large colander in the sink and pour 8 cups boiling water over top to wilt leaves. Run under cold water to rinse, then squeeze leaves thoroughly with your hands to remove excess liquid.\\nHeat 2 Tbsp. oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Add radishes and cook, tossing occasionally, until golden and crisp-tender, 5–7 minutes. Add kale and stir, breaking up leaves, until warmed through. Push kale and radishes to one side of skillet. Pour remaining 1 Tbsp. oil on the empty side and add sliced garlic. As soon as garlic starts to sizzle, stir it into vegetables. Remove pan from heat and add lemon juice to mixture; season with salt. Toss well.\\nTear meatballs in half and add to skillet along with any pan juices. Toss everything together; divide among plates.   \n",

Generously butter pan and set aside. Pulse almonds, flour, sugar, and salt in a food processor until almonds are finely ground and mixture is combined. Add egg yolks and pulse to incorporate. Add 3 Tbsp. butter to mixture and pulse until dough is the consistency of wet sand.\\nPress crust into the bottom and 3/4\" up the sides of prepared pan using a straight-sided measuring cup. Chill until firm, about 10 minutes.\\nBake crust until evenly golden brown and set, 12–14 minutes. (If it slumps during cooking, you can always press it back into place with the measuring cup while it’s still warm.) Transfer pan to a wire rack and let crust cool.\\nKeep oven at 325°F. Using an electric mixer on medium speed, beat cream cheese in a medium bowl until no lumps remain, about 1 minute. Add ricotta and sour cream and beat until well incorporated. Add egg yolks and egg one at a time, beating well between each addition. With the motor running, gradually add sugar and salt and beat until filling is creamy and smooth, about 2 minutes. Add almond extract, vanilla extract, lemon zest, and orange zest and mix just to incorporate.\\nSet pan with prepared crust on a large sheet of foil and fold up foil tightly around sides of pan (you can turn 2 small sheets of foil into 1 large sheet by folding their edges together several times, then opening up like a book). Repeat with several more pieces of foil to create a waterproof seal around the bottom and up the sides of the pan. Set inside a large roasting pan or baking dish and pour filling into crust (it will go above the crust).\\nSet roasting pan on oven rack and carefully pour in very hot water to come about halfway up the side of the springform pan. Bake ricotta pie until the top is set and dry to touch but the filling still wobbles underneath (it will firm as it cools), 65–75 minutes. Transfer to the refrigerator and chill until cool and firm, 3–4 hours.\\nSlice ricotta pie and serve topped with amarena cherries.\\nCrust can be baked 1 day ahead. Store tightly covered at room temperature. Ricotta pie can be made 3 days ahead. Keep chilled.   \n",

Add the garlic, chili powder, and cumin. Cook until fragrant, stirring constantly, about 30 seconds. Add the tomato paste and sauté for another minute, stirring constantly. Add the rinsed quinoa and water, and stir to combine. Bring the mixture to a gentle boil, then cover the pot and reduce the heat as necessary to maintain a gentle simmer. Cook until the liquid is absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes (the quinoa might not be fluffy yet, but don’t worry).\\nRemove the pot from the heat and let it rest, still covered, for 5 minutes. Then, uncover and fluff the quinoa with a fork. Gently stir in the black beans and salt. Season to taste with pepper and additional salt, if necessary. Cover and set aside for a couple of minutes to warm up the beans.\\nIn a large skillet, warm the olive oil over medium heat until shimmering. Toss in the tortilla strips, sprinkle them with salt, and stir. Cook until the strips are crispy and turning golden, stirring occasionally, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain the tortilla strips on a plate covered with a piece of paper towel.\\nIn a small food processor or blender, combine the lime juice, olive oil, and water. Using a spoon, scoop in the half avocado and add the cilantro, jalapeño, garlic, and salt. Process until the dressing is nice and smooth. The dressing should be zippy, but if it’s unpleasantly tart or difficult to blend, dilute it with 1 to 2 tablespoons of water and blend again.\\nCombine the romaine and arugula in a large bowl. Wait to dress the salad until you are ready to serve, as the greens wilt fairly quickly once dressed. (If you won’t be consuming all 4 servings of this salad right away, portion off the greens you’d like to save for later, and dress only the greens you intend to eat now.)\\nWhen you’re ready, drizzle the mixture with just enough dressing to lightly coat the greens (you might have extra). Toss until the dressing is evenly distributed.\\nArrange the dressed greens in 4 individual salad bowls (or dinner plates, if your bowls are on the small side). Top each salad with taco filling, tomatoes, radishes, crispy tortilla strips, and feta. Slice the remaining avocado half into long strips and place a couple of strips on each salad. Serve immediately.\\nIf you have leftover dressing, press plastic wrap against the surface to prevent browning and store it in the refrigerator for later. Leftover tortilla strips tend to become unpalatably tough within a couple of hours, so you might want to skip those and add a few crushed tortilla chips to leftovers.   \n",

In a large bowl, combine the ground pork with the spice mixture, salt, and black pepper. Give the sausage a good mix, separate it into four equal portions, and shape them into patties. The patties should be just larger than the width of the English muffins, as they will shrink when cooked.\\nHeat two large skillets, one over medium heat and the other over medium-low heat. Pour the olive oil into the first pan and, working in batches if necessary, fry the sausage patties for 5 minutes per side, or until crispy and cooked through. When you flip the patties, top each with cheese.\\nMelt the butter in the second pan. Crack in the eggs, taking care to not break the yolks. Gently fry the eggs until the whites have set but the yolks are still nice and runny.\\nWhile the eggs and sausage are cooking, spoon a heaping spoonful of the mayo onto each muffin half.\\nTo build each breakfast sandwich, lay a sausage patty, tomato slice, and fried egg on each English muffin bottom. Sprinkle each egg with a pinch of salt and black pepper, then top with a lettuce leaf and the other muffin half. Serve immediately.   \n",

Pour in water to cover by 3\" and bring to a simmer; cook, uncovered, until beans are very tender, 2–2 1/2 hours.\\nDrain beans, reserving cooking liquid. Pluck out epazote and bay leaf and transfer beans to a large bowl. Using a potato masher, crush beans, adding 3/4 cup of the cooking liquid a few tablespoons at a time, until a coarse texture forms. There should still be some bits of beans visible. Season with salt. If using avocado leaves, grind in a mortar and pestle or spice mill; mix into beans.\\nHeat oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Add beans (be careful as oil may bubble and spit at you) and fry, undisturbed, 2 minutes. Stir and fry for another 2 minutes. Repeat process two more times, scraping up any browned bits. Taste and season with more salt if needed. Remove beans from heat.\\nToast a tortilla in a nonstick skillet over medium heat until golden brown in spots but not crunchy, about 2 minutes. Turn; toast on other side, another minute or so. Spread a thin layer of fat over one side of tortilla (about 1 tsp.). Spread 2 Tbsp. bean mixture over; sprinkle with one-quarter of 3 oz. queso fresco. Cook until edges of tortilla curl up a bit and beans are warmed through, about 2 minutes. Repeat process with 7 more tortillas.\\nTop tortillas with rajas or chorizo and eggs and more queso fresco if desired. Serve with salsa.\\nRoast poblanos over an open flame, rotating occasionally, until charred and blistered all over, 10–12 minutes. (Or broil on a rimmed baking sheet 8–10 minutes). Remove stems, skins, and seeds. Slice flesh into 1/2” strips.\\nHeat oil in a large skillet over medium. Add onion and garlic and season with salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is translucent and softened, 10–12 minutes. Mix in chiles and oregano; taste and season with more salt. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until flavors meld and vegetables are very soft, 5–8 minutes. Keep warm until ready to serve.\\nHeat 2 Tbsp. oil in a medium skillet, preferably cast iron, over medium-high. Cook chorizo, using a spoon or heatproof spatula to break up any large pieces, until cooked through and starting to brown, 5–8 minutes. Transfer to a small bowl.\\nHeat remaining 2 Tbsp. oil in a medium nonstick skillet over medium-high. Sprinkle some salt onto the skillet. Crack eggs onto salt and immediately break yolks. Cook until underside is starting to brown, about 1 minute. Turn eggs and cook another 30 seconds (yolk won’t be entirely runny but shouldn’t be cooked through, either).   \n",
