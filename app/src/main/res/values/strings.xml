    <string name="string_dairy_info">Lactose is a sugar found in milk and dairy products.\n\nIt is broken down in the body by an enzyme called lactase , which is necessary in order for lactose to be properly digested and absorbed.\n\nLactose intolerance is caused by a shortage of lactase enzymes, which causes an inability to digest lactose and results in digestive symptoms.</string>
    <string name="string_gluten_info">Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye and other grains.\nAn individual can be born with or develop a gluten intolerance later in life\nFor most gluten intolerance individuals, doctors believe that their bodies cannot absorb carbohydrates correctly, which results in fermentation in their stomach which leads to sickness.\nApproximately 6% of the US population has a gluten intolerance, with the number higher for women than men.</string>
    <string name="string_soy_info">Soy is a plant-based product found in many Asian meals.\n\nSoy is also widely popular in vegetarian and vegan dishes and is added to meals as a protein replacement for typical meat-based products.\n\nSensitivity to soy is commonly seen in young children, however they typically outgrow it as they become an adult.</string>

    <string name="string_fodmaps_info">FODMAPs is an acronym for Fermentable Oligosaccharides Disaccharides Monosaccharides and Polyols.\nThese are found in a wide variety of foods and is typically one of the hardest food intolerances to diagnose.\n\nHowever, typically they are found in certain carbohydrates with symptoms similar to gluten intolerances.</string>
    <string name="string_salicylates_info">Salicylates are a group of chemicals derived from salicylic acid.\nThey are typically used in food preservatives and some medications.\nIndividuals who are sensitive to salicylates lack the ability to metabolize and excrete salicylates.\nSalicylate sensitivity is thought to be caused by an excessive build-up of leukotrienes in the body.\nIt is also more common in individuals who suffer from asthma.</string>
    <string name="string_histamine_info">Histamine is a chemical in the body that releases stomach acid and communicates messages with the brain.\n\nA histamine intolerance is a sign that an individual is overproducing histamine, causing an adverse reaction to bodily functions.\n\nFortunately histamine levels can be managed with a careful diet.</string>
